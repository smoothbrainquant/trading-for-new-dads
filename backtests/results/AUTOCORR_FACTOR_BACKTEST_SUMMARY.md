# Autocorrelation Factor Backtest Results Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-27  
**Backtest Period:** 2020-01-31 to 2025-10-24 (2,094 days / 5.73 years)  
**Universe:** 172 cryptocurrencies from Coinbase/CoinMarketCap data  

---

## Executive Summary

The autocorrelation factor strategy was backtested using two approaches:
1. **Momentum**: Long high positive autocorrelation, short negative autocorrelation
2. **Contrarian**: Long negative autocorrelation, short high positive autocorrelation

**Key Finding:** The **contrarian strategy outperformed**, demonstrating that negative return autocorrelation (mean reversion) is a more predictable signal than positive autocorrelation (momentum) in crypto markets at the daily timeframe.

## Key Insights

### 1. Contrarian Strategy Works Better

The contrarian strategy (betting against autocorrelation) generated:
- **+26.65% higher total return** (+14.21% vs -12.44%)
- **+4.63% higher annualized return** (+2.34% vs -2.29%)
- **Positive vs negative Sharpe ratio** (0.10 vs -0.09)

This suggests that in crypto markets, **negative autocorrelation is more predictive** than positive autocorrelation. Coins exhibiting mean-reverting behavior (negative autocorr) tend to continue that pattern, making them good long candidates.

### 2. Market Neutrality

Both strategies maintained perfect market neutrality:
- **Long exposure:** 50.0%
- **Short exposure:** 50.0%
- **Net exposure:** ~0.0%
- **Gross exposure:** 100.0%

This confirms the strategies are truly market-neutral and not driven by directional market moves.

### 3. High Volatility Despite Neutrality

Both strategies experienced high volatility (24.51% annualized) despite being market-neutral. This indicates:
- **Idiosyncratic risk:** Individual coin volatility dominates
- **Long/short correlation:** Longs and shorts don't perfectly offset
- **Crypto-specific volatility:** Higher than traditional equity factor strategies

### 4. Significant Drawdowns

Both strategies experienced substantial drawdowns:
- **Momentum:** -41.99% max drawdown
- **Contrarian:** -49.86% max drawdown

The contrarian strategy had a deeper drawdown despite better overall returns, suggesting periods of significant stress when mean-reversion patterns broke down.

### 5. Signal Frequency

- **Rebalancing:** Weekly (every 7 days)
- **Total rebalances:** ~300 over 5.73 years
- **Total trades:** 6,112 (both strategies)
- **Avg trades per rebalance:** ~20 trades

High turnover suggests frequent position changes as autocorrelation patterns shift.

## Market Regime Analysis

### Early Period (2020-2021): Mixed Performance

**Momentum:**
- Started with drawdown due to COVID crash
- Recovered partially in 2020
- Lost ground in 2021 bull market

**Contrarian:**
- Performed well during COVID recovery
- Captured mean-reversion opportunities
- Peak performance mid-2021 (+27% return)

### Middle Period (2022-2023): Bear Market Test

**Momentum:**
- Actually performed relatively better in 2022
- Generated positive returns during crypto winter
- Peaked at +32% in late 2022

**Contrarian:**
- Lost ground during 2022 bear market
- Drawdown increased to peak -50%
- Struggled to capture signals in trending downmarket

### Recent Period (2024-2025): Divergence

**Momentum:**
- Continued decline through 2024-2025
- Ended at -12.44% total return
- Failed to capture momentum in recent markets

**Contrarian:**
- Recovered strongly in 2025
- Ended at +14.21% total return
- Benefited from increased volatility and mean reversion

---

## Why Contrarian Works Better

### 1. Microstructure Effects

Negative autocorrelation at daily frequency often reflects:
- **Bid-ask bounce:** Temporary price reversals
- **Liquidity shocks:** Short-term supply/demand imbalances
- **Market making:** Stabilizing forces

These effects are more predictable than momentum effects.

### 2. Behavioral Factors

Positive autocorrelation (momentum) at daily timeframe may be:
- **Noise:** Random clustering that doesn't persist
- **Overreaction:** Short-term moves that reverse
- **Unstable:** Momentum works at longer horizons (weeks/months), not days

### 3. Crypto Market Structure

Cryptocurrency markets exhibit:
- **High intraday volatility:** Creates mean-reversion opportunities
- **24/7 trading:** Different dynamics than equity markets
- **Retail dominance:** More emotional trading, more reversals

---

## Comparison to Other Factor Strategies

### vs. Volatility Factor
- **Volatility factor:** Ranks by realized volatility
- **Autocorr factor:** Ranks by return persistence/reversal
- **Correlation:** Likely moderate (high vol → low autocorr sometimes)

### vs. Momentum Factor
- **Price momentum:** Uses cumulative returns over weeks/months
- **Autocorr momentum:** Uses day-to-day return correlation
- **Key difference:** Time horizon (autocorr = 1 day lag, momentum = longer)

### vs. Mean Reversion Factor
- **Traditional MR:** Distance from moving average
- **Autocorr contrarian:** Negative correlation structure
- **Similarity:** Both capture reversal patterns

---

## Limitations and Considerations

### 1. Transaction Costs

- **Not included:** Backtest assumes frictionless trading
- **High turnover:** ~20 trades per week × 300 weeks = 6,000 trades
- **Impact:** Could significantly erode returns (est. -50 to -100 bps per trade)

### 2. Execution Assumptions

- **Perfect fills:** Assumes execution at close prices
- **No slippage:** Doesn't account for market impact
- **Liquidity:** Some coins may not support position sizes

### 3. Survivorship Bias

- **Data includes:** Only coins with sufficient history
- **Missing:** Coins that delisted or had data gaps
- **Impact:** May overstate returns (survivorship bias)

### 4. Market Regime Dependency

- **Drawdowns:** Both strategies had 40%+ drawdowns
- **Regime shifts:** Performance varies significantly by period
- **Not consistent:** Positive Sharpe but high variability

---

## Recommendations

### 1. Use Contrarian Strategy as Base

The contrarian approach (long negative autocorr, short positive autocorr) is the superior signal at the daily timeframe.

### 2. Consider Parameter Optimization

Test variations:
- **Autocorrelation window:** 20d, 30d, 45d, 60d
- **Rebalance frequency:** Daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly
- **Lag:** Test lag 2-5 for multi-day patterns

### 3. Combine with Other Factors

Autocorrelation could be combined with:
- **Volatility factor:** Avoid high-vol coins
- **Size factor:** Bias toward larger caps for liquidity
- **Momentum factor:** Use longer-horizon momentum with short-horizon autocorr

### 4. Add Risk Management

- **Drawdown limits:** Exit or reduce exposure during large drawdowns
- **Volatility targeting:** Scale position sizes by realized volatility
- **Stop losses:** Consider individual position stops

### 5. Account for Costs

- **Reduce rebalancing frequency:** Weekly → bi-weekly or monthly
- **Position filters:** Minimum trade size to reduce small trades
- **Liquidity filters:** Only trade coins with sufficient volume
