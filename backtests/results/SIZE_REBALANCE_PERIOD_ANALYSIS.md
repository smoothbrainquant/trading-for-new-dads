**Date:** 2025-10-29  
**Analysis Period:** 2020-01-31 to 2025-10-24 (5.73 years)  
**Strategy:** Long small-cap / Short large-cap (Long/Short Market Neutral)

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis evaluates the size factor strategy across **7 different rebalance periods** [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 30 days] to identify the optimal rebalancing frequency. The size factor strategy goes long on the smallest market cap cryptocurrencies (bottom quintile) and short on the largest market cap cryptocurrencies (top quintile), using risk parity weighting.

### Key Findings

**üèÜ Optimal Rebalance Period: 10 Days**

- **Best Sharpe Ratio:** 0.39
- **Highest Annualized Return:** 15.89%
- **Final Value:** $23,288.61 (133% total return)
- **Maximum Drawdown:** -41.86%

The 10-day rebalance period provides the best risk-adjusted returns, balancing transaction costs with portfolio optimization.

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Returns Performance

**Trend:** Returns increase with rebalance frequency from 1-10 days, then decline at 30 days.

- **Daily rebalancing (1d):** Underperforms significantly (+11.26% annually)
  - Likely due to excessive transaction costs and whipsaw trades
  
- **Sweet spot (3-10d):** Strong performance (+15.26% to +15.89% annually)
  - Captures alpha while managing transaction costs
  - 3-5 day rebalancing shows consistent ~15.4% returns
  
- **Monthly rebalancing (30d):** Moderate underperformance (+12.68% annually)
  - Portfolio drifts too far from optimal allocation
  - Misses tactical opportunities in crypto's volatile market

### 2. Risk-Adjusted Returns (Sharpe Ratio)

The Sharpe ratio shows a clear optimal range:

| Period Range | Sharpe Ratio | Interpretation |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| 1-2 days     | 0.28 - 0.33  | Suboptimal due to transaction drag |
| **3-10 days**| **0.37 - 0.39** | **Optimal risk-adjusted returns** |
| 30 days      | 0.31         | Suboptimal due to portfolio drift |

**Winner: 10-day rebalancing** achieves the highest Sharpe of 0.39, indicating the best risk-adjusted performance.

### 3. Maximum Drawdown Analysis

- **Best (lowest):** 3-day rebalancing at -41.74%
- **Worst:** 30-day rebalancing at -46.20%
- **10-day rebalancing:** -41.86% (second best)

Shorter rebalance periods (3-10 days) help manage downside risk by more quickly adapting to market changes. However, the differences are relatively small (4.5% range).

### 4. Win Rate Consistency

Win rates are remarkably stable across all periods (54.28% - 54.75%), suggesting the strategy's edge is consistent regardless of rebalancing frequency. The slight upward trend toward longer periods may reflect fewer trades = fewer transaction costs eating into positive returns.

### 5. Volatility

Annualized volatility remains stable around 40.5-41.0% across all rebalance periods. This consistency indicates that rebalancing frequency has minimal impact on portfolio volatility for this strategy.

## Transaction Cost Considerations

### Estimated Number of Rebalances (Approximate)

| Period | Total Rebalances | Rebalances/Year | Relative Cost |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| 1d     | 22,676          | ~3,960          | Very High     |
| 2d     | 12,470          | ~2,177          | High          |
| 3d     | 8,590           | ~1,500          | Moderate-High |
| 5d     | 5,297           | ~925            | Moderate      |
| 7d     | 3,870           | ~676            | Moderate-Low  |
| **10d**| **2,753**       | **~481**        | **Low**       |
| 30d    | 954             | ~167            | Very Low      |

**Key Insight:** The 10-day period reduces transaction count by 88% compared to daily rebalancing while maintaining superior returns. This suggests significant transaction cost savings contribute to its outperformance.

## Practical Recommendations

### 1. **Primary Recommendation: 10-Day Rebalancing**

**Rationale:**
- ‚úÖ Highest Sharpe ratio (0.39)
- ‚úÖ Highest annualized return (15.89%)
- ‚úÖ Low transaction costs (~481 rebalances/year)
- ‚úÖ Near-best maximum drawdown (-41.86%)
- ‚úÖ Practical execution frequency for manual traders

**Ideal for:** Most traders seeking optimal risk-adjusted returns with manageable transaction frequency.

### 2. **Alternative: 5-Day Rebalancing**

**Rationale:**
- Similar returns to 10-day (15.47% vs 15.89%)
- Slightly higher transaction costs but more responsive
- Good middle ground between 3-day and 10-day

**Ideal for:** Traders with automated systems who want to respond faster to market changes.

### 3. **Not Recommended:**
- **Daily (1d):** Too much transaction drag; Sharpe of only 0.28
- **Monthly (30d):** Excessive portfolio drift; worst drawdown at -46.20%

## Strategy Configuration

**Common Parameters Across All Tests:**

- **Universe:** Top 300 cryptocurrencies by market cap
- **Long Side:** Bottom quintile (smallest caps) - ~36 coins
- **Short Side:** Top quintile (largest caps) - ~15 coins
- **Weighting:** Risk parity (inverse volatility)
- **Allocation:** 50% long / 50% short (market neutral)
- **Leverage:** 1.0x (no leverage)
- **Volatility Window:** 30 days
- **Initial Capital:** $10,000

---

## Risk Considerations

1. **Market Regime Sensitivity:** The size factor may underperform in risk-off environments when investors flee to large-cap safety.

2. **Liquidity Risk:** Small-cap cryptocurrencies have lower liquidity, which could impact execution quality.

3. **Volatility:** ~41% annualized volatility requires appropriate position sizing and risk management.

4. **Drawdowns:** Maximum drawdowns of ~42% require strong risk tolerance and adequate capital buffers.

## Conclusions

### The Data Clearly Shows:

1. **Frequency Matters:** Rebalancing frequency significantly impacts returns
2. **Sweet Spot Exists:** 10-day rebalancing optimizes the return/cost tradeoff
3. **Avoid Extremes:** Both too frequent (1d) and too infrequent (30d) hurt performance
4. **Transaction Costs Count:** The performance gap between 1d and 10d (+4.6% annually) likely comes from transaction cost savings

### Implementation Guidance:

- **Start with:** 10-day rebalancing for most use cases
- **Monitor:** Transaction costs in live trading may differ from backtests
- **Adjust:** Consider 5-day if execution costs are low and automation is available
- **Avoid:** Daily or monthly rebalancing based on this analysis
