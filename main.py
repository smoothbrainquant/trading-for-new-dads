def calc_weights(volatilities):
    """
    Calculate portfolio weights based on risk parity.
    
    Risk parity is a portfolio allocation strategy that aims to equalize
    the risk contribution of each asset in the portfolio. Unlike equal
    weighting (which can lead to concentration of risk in volatile assets),
    risk parity assigns weights inversely proportional to asset volatility.
    
    Methodology:
    1. Calculate inverse volatility for each asset (1 / volatility)
    2. Sum all inverse volatilities
    3. Normalize by dividing each inverse volatility by the sum
    
    This ensures that:
    - Lower volatility assets receive higher weights
    - Higher volatility assets receive lower weights
    - All assets contribute equally to portfolio risk
    - Weights sum to 1.0 (100% of portfolio)
    
    Mathematical formula:
        weight_i = (1 / vol_i) / sum(1 / vol_j for all j)
    
    Where:
        vol_i = rolling volatility of asset i
        weight_i = resulting portfolio weight for asset i
    
    Args:
        volatilities (dict): Dictionary mapping symbols to their rolling volatility values.
                           Volatility should be expressed as standard deviation of returns.
                           Example: {'BTC/USD': 0.045, 'ETH/USD': 0.062}
        
    Returns:
        dict: Dictionary mapping symbols to their risk parity weights (summing to 1.0).
              Returns empty dict if volatilities is empty or contains invalid values.
              Example: {'BTC/USD': 0.58, 'ETH/USD': 0.42}
    
    Notes:
        - Assets with zero or negative volatility are excluded from calculation
        - If all assets have zero/invalid volatility, returns empty dict
        - Weights are normalized to sum to exactly 1.0
        - This is a simple equal risk contribution approach; more sophisticated
          implementations might consider correlations between assets
