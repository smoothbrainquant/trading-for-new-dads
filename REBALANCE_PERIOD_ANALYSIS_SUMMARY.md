# Days From High Strategy - Rebalance Period Analysis

## Overview
This analysis tests different rebalance periods for the "Days from High" momentum strategy to determine optimal holding periods. The strategy selects instruments within 20 days of their 200-day high and uses risk parity weighting (inverse volatility).

## Test Configuration
- **Strategy**: Days from 200d High (20-day threshold)
- **Data**: Top 10 markets, 500 days of daily data
- **Period**: January 27, 2025 - October 23, 2025 (270 trading days)
- **Initial Capital**: $10,000
- **Rebalance Periods Tested**: [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 30] trading days

## Results Summary

| Rebalance Period | Final Value | Total Return | Annualized Return | Sharpe Ratio | Max Drawdown | Win Rate | Num Rebalances |

## Key Findings

### üèÜ Best Performing Rebalance Period: **3 Days**
- **Best Total Return**: -7.33% (vs. -15.04% for daily rebalancing)
- **Best Sharpe Ratio**: -0.19 (least negative among all periods)
- **Moderate Trading**: 68 rebalances over 270 days
- **Reduced Transaction Costs**: ~49% fewer rebalances vs. daily

### üìä Performance Patterns

1. **Very Frequent Rebalancing (1-2 days)**
   - Highest trading costs due to frequent rebalancing
   - Lower returns likely due to whipsawing in/out of positions
   - Daily (1d) had 135 rebalances, 2x more than 3-day period

2. **Optimal Range (3-10 days)** ‚úÖ
   - **3-day rebalancing clearly outperforms**
   - 10-day also shows relatively good performance (-8.36% return)
   - Better balance between adapting to market and reducing costs

3. **Infrequent Rebalancing (30 days)**
   - Worst performance (-25.76% return)
   - Unable to adapt quickly to market changes
   - Only 9 rebalances over entire period

### üí° Insights

1. **Transaction Cost Impact**: More frequent rebalancing (daily, 2-day) appears to hurt performance, suggesting transaction costs and slippage materially impact returns

2. **Signal Decay**: The 3-day sweet spot suggests that the "days from high" signal remains relevant for ~3 trading days before requiring reassessment

3. **Risk-Adjusted Returns**: The 3-day period has the best Sharpe ratio (-0.19), indicating superior risk-adjusted performance

4. **Win Rate Pattern**: Win rate slightly improves with longer holding periods (29% for 1-2 days vs. 32% for 30 days), but this doesn't translate to better returns

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Market Context Note

All rebalance periods showed negative returns during this test period (Jan-Oct 2025), indicating challenging market conditions for this momentum strategy. The analysis focuses on **relative performance** across rebalance periods rather than absolute profitability.

## Recommendations

1. **Use 3-day rebalancing** as the primary strategy
   - Best risk-adjusted returns
   - Reasonable trading frequency (68 rebalances in 270 days)
   - Reduces transaction costs vs. daily rebalancing

2. **Consider 10-day as alternative** for lower turnover environments
   - Second-best performance (-8.36% return)
   - Only 25 rebalances, significantly lower transaction costs
   - Higher win rate (31.23%)

3. **Avoid daily and 30-day extremes**
   - Daily: Too frequent, likely eroded by costs
   - 30-day: Too infrequent, misses market regime changes
