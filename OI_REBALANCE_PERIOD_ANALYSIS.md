# OI Divergence & Trend - Rebalance Period Analysis

**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Analysis Period:** November 2020 - October 2025  
**Rebalance Periods Tested:** [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 30] days

## Executive Summary

This analysis backtests the Open Interest (OI) Divergence and Trend strategies across different rebalance periods to identify optimal trading frequencies. The study compares performance metrics including returns, Sharpe ratios, and maximum drawdowns.

### Key Findings

**OI Divergence Strategy:**
- ✅ **Best Performer:** 7-day rebalance period
  - Annualized Return: **7.59%**
  - Sharpe Ratio: **0.193**
  - Max Drawdown: -57.76%

**OI Trend Strategy:**
- ✅ **Best Performer:** 5-day rebalance period
  - Annualized Return: **2.80%**
  - Sharpe Ratio: **0.073**
  - Max Drawdown: -52.74%

### Strategic Insight

**The OI Divergence strategy significantly outperforms the OI Trend strategy**, particularly at the 7-day rebalance frequency. The divergence approach (contrarian to price, validated by OI) shows stronger risk-adjusted returns than the trend-following approach.

| **7 days** ⭐    | **$14,283** | **+42.83%**  | **+7.59%**  | **0.193**    | **-57.76%**  |
| 10 days         | $11,737     | +17.37%      | +3.34%      | 0.089        | -54.65%      |

- The **7-day rebalance period is optimal**, showing the best Sharpe ratio and returns
- Longer periods (10-30 days) show positive but lower returns than 7 days
- The strategy appears to benefit from weekly rebalancing, possibly capturing medium-term divergence patterns

## Comparative Analysis

### Strategy Comparison at Optimal Rebalance Periods

| Metric                | OI Divergence (7d) | OI Trend (5d) | Winner      |
|-----------------------|-------------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Total Return**      | +42.83%           | +14.40%       | Divergence  |
| **Annualized Return** | +7.59%            | +2.80%        | Divergence  |
| **Sharpe Ratio**      | 0.193             | 0.073         | Divergence  |
| **Max Drawdown**      | -57.76%           | -52.74%       | Trend       |
| **Optimal Frequency** | 7 days            | 5 days        | -           |

**The OI Divergence strategy delivers 2.7x better annualized returns and 2.6x better Sharpe ratio compared to the OI Trend strategy at their respective optimal rebalance frequencies.**

### Rebalance Frequency Patterns

**Short-Term (1-3 days):**
- Both strategies struggle with very frequent rebalancing
- Likely impacted by noise and transaction costs
- Divergence: -9.40% to -1.87%
- Trend: +0.44% to -19.54%

**Medium-Term (5-7 days):**
- **Sweet spot for both strategies**
- Divergence peaks at 7 days (+42.83%)
- Trend peaks at 5 days (+14.40%)
- Captures meaningful OI-price relationships without over-trading

**Long-Term (10-30 days):**
- Both strategies show declining performance
- Divergence: +17.37% to +19.73% (still positive)
- Trend: -18.51% to -3.75% (negative)
- May miss timely entry/exit points

## Risk Analysis

### Drawdown Comparison

**OI Divergence:**
- Lowest drawdown: -48.61% (1-day rebalance)
- Highest drawdown: -64.17% (5-day rebalance)
- Optimal 7-day: -57.76%

**OI Trend:**
- Lowest drawdown: -52.74% (5-day rebalance)
- Highest drawdown: -61.86% (10-day rebalance)
- Optimal 5-day: -52.74%

**Both strategies experience significant drawdowns (>50%), reflecting the high volatility of cryptocurrency markets. The trend strategy shows slightly better drawdown control at its optimal frequency.**

### Volatility Analysis

Both strategies exhibit similar annualized volatility across all rebalance periods:
- Average volatility: ~38-39%
- Relatively stable across different rebalancing frequencies
- Consistent with broader crypto market volatility

## Recommendations

### For OI Divergence Strategy:
1. ✅ **Use 7-day rebalance period** for optimal risk-adjusted returns
2. Consider 10-30 day periods as alternatives with lower but still positive returns
3. Avoid very short rebalance periods (1-5 days) which show negative performance

### For OI Trend Strategy:
1. ✅ **Use 5-day rebalance period** if implementing this strategy
2. Be aware that overall performance is significantly weaker than divergence
3. Consider switching to the divergence strategy for better results

### General Trading Recommendations:
1. **Prefer the OI Divergence strategy over OI Trend** for significantly better performance
2. Weekly (7-day) rebalancing appears optimal for capturing OI-price divergences
3. Avoid daily or near-daily rebalancing which introduces noise and potentially higher costs
4. Be prepared for substantial drawdowns (50-60%) and ensure appropriate risk management
5. Consider combining with other factors for portfolio diversification

## Methodology

**Data Sources:**
- Price data: Combined Coinbase/CoinMarketCap daily prices (2020-2025)
- OI data: Coinalyze aggregated open interest for 662 perpetual futures (Nov 2020 - Oct 2025)

**Backtest Parameters:**
- Initial capital: $10,000
- Position sizing: Risk parity within long/short sides (30-day volatility)
- Universe: Top 10 long, Bottom 10 short based on OI divergence/trend scores
- Lookback window: 30 days for score calculation
- Next-day returns used to avoid lookahead bias

**Strategy Definitions:**
- **Divergence:** Contrarian to price, validated by OI (long when OI rises but price falls)
- **Trend:** Following price, confirmed by OI (long when both price and OI rise)

## Conclusion

The rebalance period analysis reveals that **weekly (7-day) rebalancing is optimal for the OI Divergence strategy**, delivering strong risk-adjusted returns of 7.59% annually with a Sharpe ratio of 0.193. This significantly outperforms the OI Trend strategy, which achieves its best (but much lower) performance at a 5-day rebalance frequency.

The superior performance of the divergence strategy suggests that **contrarian positions validated by open interest changes are more profitable than trend-following approaches** in the cryptocurrency futures market. This may be due to:
1. Mean reversion tendencies after short-term price-OI divergences
2. Smart money positioning against retail flows
3. Market inefficiencies in OI-price relationships

Traders implementing these strategies should prioritize the OI Divergence approach with weekly rebalancing, while maintaining strict risk management given the substantial drawdowns inherent in crypto markets.
