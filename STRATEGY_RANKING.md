## Tier 1: Elite Strategies (Sharpe > 0.7)

### 1. Mean Reversion (Z-Score) - Sharpe 6.38 üèÜ

**Economic Rationale (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê):**
- **Theory:** Extreme price moves in crypto are driven by sentiment and overreaction, creating predictable reversals
- **Mechanism:** High volume + large moves = exhaustion ‚Üí mean reversion
- **TradFi Evidence:** Strong - behavioral finance shows overreaction and correction patterns
- **Crypto Application:** Enhanced by thin markets, retail dominance, 24/7 trading creating overshoots

**Backtest Performance:**
- Sharpe Ratio: 6.38 (exceptional)
- Total Return: 556.0% (1,140.9% annualized)
- Max Drawdown: -64.7% (manageable given returns)
- Win Rate: 51.3%

**Regime Stability:**
- Medium - Works best in volatile, mean-reverting markets
- Struggles in sustained trends
- 2021-2025 included significant volatility, favorable environment

**Key Insight:** Best risk-adjusted returns by far. Strategy captures behavioral overreactions in crypto's volatile environment.

---

### 2. Size Factor (Small Cap Premium) - Sharpe 1.03

**Economic Rationale (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê):**
- **Theory:** Small caps offer illiquidity premium + higher growth potential
- **Mechanism:** Less liquid, higher beta, overlooked by institutions
- **TradFi Evidence:** Very Strong - Fama-French size factor (1992), one of most researched anomalies
- **Crypto Application:** Enhanced by extreme fragmentation and retail-heavy market

**Backtest Performance:**
- Sharpe Ratio: 1.03
- Total Return: 45.5%
- Max Drawdown: -30.2% (best risk control)
- Win Rate: 52.9%

**Regime Stability:**
- High - Consistent across bull/bear/sideways markets
- Small caps outperform in risk-on, hold up reasonably in risk-off
- Most stable factor strategy

**Key Insight:** Classic factor with strongest academic pedigree. Works in crypto as it does in equities.

---

### 3. Carry Factor (Funding Rates) - Sharpe 0.92

**Economic Rationale (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê):**
- **Theory:** Funding rate differentials create predictable arbitrage opportunities
- **Mechanism:** Long negative funding (receive payments), short positive funding (receive payments)
- **TradFi Evidence:** Strong - FX carry trade is well-documented
- **Crypto Application:** Perpetual futures unique to crypto, 8-hour funding creates high-frequency opportunities

**Backtest Performance:**
- Sharpe Ratio: 0.92
- Total Return: 3.8% (limited sample period - 58 days)
- Max Drawdown: -6.3% (excellent risk control)
- Win Rate: 31.6% (lower but asymmetric payoff)

**Regime Stability:**
- Very High - Works in all market conditions
- Funding rates adjust to market sentiment
- Mean-reverting, not directional

**Key Insight:** Crypto-native strategy exploiting perpetual futures mechanics. Low correlation to market direction.

---

### 4. Beta Factor (Betting Against Beta) - Sharpe 0.72

**Economic Rationale (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê):**
- **Theory:** Low-beta assets outperform high-beta assets on risk-adjusted basis
- **Mechanism:** Leverage constraints + behavioral preference for "lottery" coins = high-beta overvalued
- **TradFi Evidence:** Very Strong - Frazzini & Pedersen (2014), Black (1972), replicated globally
- **Crypto Application:** Retail-heavy market with easy leverage access but suboptimal use

**Backtest Performance:**
- Sharpe Ratio: 0.72 (risk parity), 0.64 (equal weight)
- Total Return: 218.5% (risk parity)
- Max Drawdown: -40.9%
- Win Rate: 43.4%

**Regime Stability:**
- High - Market neutral structure provides stability
- Long low-beta coins are defensive
- Short high-beta coins hedge risk

**Key Insight:** Low volatility anomaly exists in crypto as in equities. BAB >> traditional risk premium.

---

## Tier 2: Solid Strategies (Sharpe 0.4-0.7)

### 5. OI Divergence (Divergence Mode) - Sharpe 0.68

**Economic Rationale (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê):**
- **Theory:** Price up + OI down = weak rally (shorts covering), expect reversal
- **Mechanism:** Open interest divergence signals false breakouts and exhaustion
- **TradFi Evidence:** Medium - Volume-price relationships studied, OI less so
- **Crypto Application:** Derivatives-heavy market, OI data widely available

**Backtest Performance:**
- Sharpe Ratio: 0.68
- Total Return: 57.9%
- Max Drawdown: -50.1%
- Win Rate: 51.0%

**Regime Stability:**
- Medium - Contrarian strategy works better in range-bound markets
- Struggles in sustained trends
- Requires liquid derivatives markets

**Key Insight:** Crypto-specific strategy using derivatives data. Good contrarian signal but regime-dependent.

---

## Tier 3: Marginal Strategies (Sharpe 0.0-0.4)

### 6. ADF Factor (Trend Following Premium) - Sharpe 0.15

**Economic Rationale (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê):**
- **Theory:** Trending coins (non-stationary) capture momentum; stationary coins mean-revert
- **Mechanism:** ADF test identifies time series properties - trend vs. mean reversion
- **TradFi Evidence:** Medium - Statistical arbitrage literature, pairs trading
- **Crypto Application:** Tests if mean reversion or momentum dominates

**Backtest Performance:**
- Sharpe Ratio: 0.15 (trend following), -0.40 (mean reversion)
- Total Return: 20.8% (trend), -42.9% (mean reversion)
- Max Drawdown: -44.4% (trend), -72.5% (mean reversion)

**Regime Stability:**
- Low - Highly regime-dependent
- 2021-2025 was trending period (trend following won)
- Mean reversion failed catastrophically

**Key Insight:** Strategy is picking up momentum vs. mean reversion. ADF adds statistical sophistication but result is similar to momentum factor. Regime risk is high.

---

### 7. Volatility Factor (Low Vol Anomaly) - Sharpe -0.07

**Economic Rationale (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê):**
- **Theory:** Low volatility stocks outperform high volatility stocks on risk-adjusted basis
- **Mechanism:** Attention bias, lottery preferences, leverage constraints
- **TradFi Evidence:** Strong - Baker, Bradley & Wurgler (2011), Ang et al. (2006)
- **Crypto Application:** Retail-heavy market should exhibit behavioral biases

**Backtest Performance:**
- Sharpe Ratio: -0.07 (long low, short high)
- Total Return: -3.8%
- Max Drawdown: -45.7%
- Win Rate: 49.7%

**Regime Stability:**
- Low - Underperformed in 2023-2025 period
- Theory says should work, but didn't in sample period
- May need longer time horizon

**Key Insight:** Low vol anomaly exists in theory and TradFi, but hasn't materialized in crypto backtest. Could be: (1) insufficient sample size, (2) crypto different, (3) regime mismatch.

---

### 8. Kurtosis Factor (Momentum) - Sharpe -0.07

**Economic Rationale (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê):**
- **Theory:** Fat-tailed distributions predict future returns
- **Mechanism:** High kurtosis = extreme moves = momentum or exhaustion
- **TradFi Evidence:** Medium - Higher moments in asset pricing (Harvey-Siddique 2000)
- **Crypto Application:** Crypto has extreme kurtosis, may be predictive

**Backtest Performance:**
- Sharpe Ratio: -0.07 (momentum variant)
- Total Return: -4.5%
- Max Drawdown: -61.0%
- Win Rate: 47.1%

**Regime Stability:**
- Low - Unclear which regime favors high vs. low kurtosis
- Backtest period showed negative results
- Limited theoretical clarity on direction

**Key Insight:** Interesting theoretical angle but empirical results weak. Fourth moment may not add value beyond volatility (second moment).

---

## Tier 4: In Development

### 9. Skew Factor - Sharpe TBD üìù

**Economic Rationale (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê):**
- **Theory:** Return skewness predicts future returns through mean reversion or risk premium
- **Mechanism:** Negative skew = crash risk = compensation required
- **TradFi Evidence:** Medium - Harvey & Siddique (2000) conditional skewness
- **Crypto Application:** Crypto has extreme skewness, may be priced

**Status:**
- Specification complete
- Implementation pending
- Expected to test both mean reversion and momentum hypotheses

**Expected Performance:**
- Similar to kurtosis - third moment vs. fourth moment
- May overlap with volatility and momentum factors
- Crypto-specific skewness patterns could differ from equities

---

### 10. IQR Spread Factor - Sharpe TBD üìù

**Economic Rationale (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê):**
- **Theory:** Market return dispersion signals regime changes
- **Mechanism:** Low spread = bullish breadth, high spread = divergence/topping
- **TradFi Evidence:** Medium - Market breadth indicators in equities
- **Crypto Application:** "Alt season" (low spread) vs. "BTC dominance" (high spread)

**Status:**
- Specification complete
- Implementation pending
- Rotates between majors (top 10) and small caps (51-100) based on IQR spread

**Expected Performance:**
- Market timing overlay on size factor
- Could enhance returns if regime detection works
- Risk: False signals, whipsaws

---

### 11. Pairs Trading (Basket) - Sharpe TBD üìù

**Economic Rationale (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê):**
- **Theory:** Coins in same category (e.g., DeFi, L1s) co-move; divergences revert
- **Mechanism:** Category basket mean reversion, market-neutral
- **TradFi Evidence:** Very Strong - Gatev, Goetzmann & Rouwenhorst (2006), classic strategy
- **Crypto Application:** Strong category effects (DeFi season, L1 rotation)

**Status:**
- Specification complete (comprehensive)
- Implementation pending
- Multi-phase approach with correlation analysis

**Expected Performance:**
- High potential - categories show strong correlation
- Market-neutral, lower risk
- Well-established in TradFi, should work in crypto

---

## Tier 5: Underperforming / Questionable

### 12. Breakout Signal - Sharpe N/A (Negative Returns)

**Economic Rationale (‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê):**
- **Theory:** Price breakouts signal momentum continuation
- **Mechanism:** New highs attract attention and capital
- **TradFi Evidence:** Medium - Trend following, momentum strategies
- **Crypto Application:** 24/7 trading, high momentum in crypto

**Backtest Performance:**
- Sharpe Ratio: -1.05 (negative)
- Total Return: -30.3%
- Max Drawdown: -45.7%
- Win Rate: 46.6%

**Issues:**
- Underperformed in backtest period
- May be false breakouts in choppy markets
- Entry/exit rules may need refinement

**Recommendation:** Re-evaluate parameters or consider removing from production.

---

### 13. Days from High (20d/200d) - Sharpe TBD

**Economic Rationale (‚≠ê‚≠ê):**
- **Theory:** Coins near recent highs have momentum
- **Mechanism:** Recency to all-time high signals strength
- **TradFi Evidence:** Weak - Momentum better captured by returns
- **Crypto Application:** Psychological levels matter

**Status:**
- In production but limited results available
- Likely overlaps with momentum strategies
- Weak theoretical foundation compared to alternatives

**Recommendation:** Low priority. Better momentum proxies exist (pure returns, ADF trend following).

---
