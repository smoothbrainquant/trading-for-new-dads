# Mixed Rebalance Periods - Simple Visual Guide

## 🎯 Your Question: How does it work?

You want:
- **Volatility strategy**: Rebalance daily (1 day)
- **DW strategy**: Rebalance weekly (7 days)  
- **Kurtosis strategy**: Rebalance biweekly (14 days)

**All running together!**

```

### What Happens Each Day

**Day 1 (Monday):**
```
ALL THREE strategies rebalance:
  ✓ Volatility: Recalculate signals → 8 positions
  ✓ DW Factor: Recalculate signals → 6 positions  
  ✓ Kurtosis: Recalculate signals → 7 positions
  
Aggregate: Combine all signals → 15 total positions
Execute: 15 trades to reach target positions
```

**Day 2 (Tuesday):**
```
Only Volatility rebalances:
  ✓ Volatility: Recalculate signals → 7 positions (NEW)
  - DW Factor: Hold previous signals → 6 positions (SAME)
  - Kurtosis: Hold previous signals → 7 positions (SAME)
  
Aggregate: Combine all signals → 14 total positions
Execute: 3 trades (only volatility changes)
```

**Day 3-7 (Wed-Fri):**
```
Only Volatility rebalances each day:
  ✓ Volatility: New signals daily
  - DW Factor: Hold (waiting for Day 8)
  - Kurtosis: Hold (waiting for Day 15)
```

**Day 8 (Monday):**
```
Volatility + DW rebalance:
  ✓ Volatility: Recalculate signals → 9 positions (NEW)
  ✓ DW Factor: Recalculate signals → 5 positions (NEW)
  - Kurtosis: Hold previous signals → 7 positions (SAME)
  
Aggregate: Combine all signals → 16 total positions
Execute: 8 trades (vol + DW changed)
```

**Day 15 (Monday):**
```
ALL THREE rebalance again:
  ✓ Volatility: Recalculate signals → 8 positions (NEW)
  ✓ DW Factor: Recalculate signals → 6 positions (NEW)
  ✓ Kurtosis: Recalculate signals → 8 positions (NEW)
  
Aggregate: Combine all signals → 17 total positions
Execute: 12 trades (everything rebalanced)
```

## 🔧 Two Different Contexts

### Context 1: Backtesting (What You Have Now)

**Each strategy runs independently:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ backtest_volatility_factor.py (separate process)           │
│   - Rebalances daily (1d)                                   │
│   - Tracks own portfolio: $10,000 → $16,500 (+65%)        │
│   - Output: equity_curve_volatility.csv                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ backtest_dw_factor.py (separate process)                    │
│   - Rebalances weekly (7d)                                  │
│   - Tracks own portfolio: $10,000 → $12,633 (+26.33%)     │
│   - Output: equity_curve_dw.csv                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ backtest_kurtosis_factor.py (separate process)              │
│   - Rebalances biweekly (14d)                               │
│   - Tracks own portfolio: $10,000 → $12,900 (+29%)        │
│   - Output: equity_curve_kurtosis.csv                       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Then combine results:
  Combined Sharpe-weighted portfolio → Expected Sharpe: ~0.95
```

**Key point:** They don't interact during backtesting! Fully independent.

### Context 2: Production Trading (What You Need to Build)

**One unified system manages all strategies:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                 UNIFIED TRADING SYSTEM                       │
│                                                              │
│  Daily Scheduler runs at market open:                       │
│                                                              │
│  1. Check what needs rebalancing today                      │
│     ✓ Is it Day 1, 2, 3...? → Volatility needs update      │
│     ✓ Is it Day 1, 8, 15...? → DW needs update             │
│     ✓ Is it Day 1, 15, 29...? → Kurtosis needs update      │
│                                                              │
│  2. Generate signals for strategies that need rebalancing   │
│     - Volatility: calculate_volatility_signals()            │
│     - DW Factor: calculate_dw_signals() (if Monday)         │
│     - Kurtosis: calculate_kurtosis_signals() (if Monday #2) │
│                                                              │
│  3. Aggregate all signals (weighted by strategy allocation) │
│     Example: BTC position                                   │
│     = 0.30 × Vol_BTC + 0.35 × DW_BTC + 0.35 × Kurt_BTC    │
│     = 0.30 × (+15%) + 0.35 × (+10%) + 0.35 × (-5%)        │
│     = +8.2% (net long)                                      │
│                                                              │
│  4. Calculate trades needed                                 │
│     Current BTC: +5%                                        │
│     Target BTC: +8.2%                                       │
│     Trade: +3.2% (increase position)                        │
│                                                              │
│  5. Execute trades on exchange                              │
│     exchange.create_order('BTC', 'market', 'buy', $3200)    │
│                                                              │
│  6. Update positions and track P&L                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## 💰 Position Aggregation Example

**Scenario: All three strategies have opinions on BTC**

```
Strategy Allocations:
  Volatility: 30% of capital
  DW Factor:  35% of capital
  Kurtosis:   35% of capital

Individual Signals (% of strategy capital):
  Volatility wants: BTC +50% (very bullish)
  DW Factor wants:  BTC +20% (moderately bullish)
  Kurtosis wants:   BTC -10% (slightly bearish)

Combined Position (% of total capital):
  BTC = (0.30 × 50%) + (0.35 × 20%) + (0.35 × -10%)
      = 15.0% + 7.0% - 3.5%
      = +18.5% of total capital

With $100,000 capital:
  BTC position = $18,500 (long)
```

**If one strategy updates:**

```
Day 2: Only Volatility rebalances

New Signals:
  Volatility wants: BTC +30% (still bullish, but less)
  DW Factor wants:  BTC +20% (UNCHANGED - holding from Day 1)
  Kurtosis wants:   BTC -10% (UNCHANGED - holding from Day 1)

New Combined Position:
  BTC = (0.30 × 30%) + (0.35 × 20%) + (0.35 × -10%)
      = 9.0% + 7.0% - 3.5%
      = +12.5% of total capital

Trade Needed:
  Current: $18,500 (18.5%)
  Target:  $12,500 (12.5%)
  Trade:   SELL $6,000 (-6%)
```

## 📊 Trading Activity Comparison

### If All Strategies Rebalanced Daily:

```
Days per year: 252 (trading days)
Average positions per strategy: 10

Total trades:
  = 3 strategies × 10 positions × 252 days
  = 7,560 position changes per year
  
With 0.1% transaction cost:
  = 756% in costs! (IMPOSSIBLE!)
```

### With Mixed Frequencies:

```
Volatility (daily):
  = 10 positions × 252 days = 2,520 position changes

DW Factor (weekly):
  = 10 positions × 52 weeks = 520 position changes

Kurtosis (biweekly):
  = 10 positions × 26 periods = 260 position changes

Total trades:
  = 2,520 + 520 + 260 = 3,300 position changes
  
With 0.1% transaction cost:
  = 330% in costs (still high, but 56% reduction!)
```

**Benefit: 56% fewer trades, 56% lower costs!**

## ✅ Implementation: What You Actually Need to Code

### For Backtesting (Already Done ✅)

```bash
# Just run this - it handles mixed frequencies automatically
python3 backtests/scripts/run_all_backtests.py \
  --data-file data/raw/combined_coinbase_coinmarketcap_daily.csv

# Each strategy runs with its own rebalance frequency:
# - Volatility: 1 day (automatic)
# - DW Factor: 7 days (automatic)
# - Kurtosis: 14 days (automatic)
```

### For Production Trading (Need to Build)

**Minimal implementation:**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""Simple mixed-frequency trading system."""

import datetime

# Strategy configurations
STRATEGIES = {
    'volatility': {'rebalance_days': 1, 'allocation': 0.30},

        allocation = STRATEGIES[strategy_name]['allocation']
        
        for symbol, weight in strategy_signals.items():
            if symbol not in combined:

    print(f"Executing {len(positions)} positions")
    for symbol, weight in positions.items():
        print(f"  {symbol}: {weight:+.2%}")

# Main loop
if __name__ == '__main__':
    start_date = datetime.date(2024, 1, 1)
    
    for day_offset in range(365):
        today = start_date + datetime.timedelta(days=day_offset)
        
        # Skip weekends
        if today.weekday() < 5:
            run_daily_trading(today)

## 🎯 Bottom Line

### Your Question: "How will it work to handle mixed rebalance periods?"

### Answer:

**1. In Backtesting (current):**
- ✅ Already works! Each strategy backtests independently.
- ✅ No interaction between strategies during backtest.
- ✅ Results combined at analysis stage.

**2. In Production (future):**
- 📝 Need to build unified system.
- 📝 Daily scheduler checks what needs rebalancing.
- 📝 Aggregate signals from active strategies.
- 📝 Execute only net trades needed.

**Key insight:** Strategies don't interfere - they each contribute signals based on their own schedule, and the system combines them appropriately.
