**Bucket 2 ($700M-$1B market cap)** delivered:
- Average Sharpe: **1.66** (highest)
- Average return: +83% per year
- Win rate: 81%
- **Sweet spot**: Established but still room to grow

**Bucket 1 ($500M-$700M)** showed:
- Highest win rate: **93%**
- Strong Sharpe: **1.04**
- Average return: +146% (second highest)
- Never had a negative year (though data missing for 2022-2023)

- Bucket 5 (Smallest): **-76%**, Sharpe: **-4.98**
- Bucket 4: **-75%**, Sharpe: **-3.17**
- Bucket 3: **-54%**, Sharpe: **-2.38**

## Investment Implications

### For Maximum Returns (High Risk)
✅ **Tactical Rotation Strategy**
- Bull markets: Overweight mid-caps (Buckets 3-4)
- Recovery phases: Favor varied buckets based on narrative
- Avoid during bear markets
- **5-year avg return: +131-144%**, but volatile

### For Best Risk-Adjusted Returns (Moderate Risk)
✅ **Bucket 2 Focus ($700M-$1B market cap)**
- Sharpe ratio: **1.66**
- Win rate: **81%**
- Returns: **+83%** per year
- Sweet spot between size and stability
- **Recommended for most investors**

### For Consistency (Lower Risk)
✅ **Bucket 1 Concentration ($500M-$700M)**
- Win rate: **93%** (highest)
- Sharpe: **1.04**
- Returns: **+146%** (strong)
- Most established near-large caps
- Best for risk-averse

### What to Avoid
❌ **Don't assume size factor works like equities**
- No consistent small-cap premium
- Market cycle matters more than size
- Need tactical approach, not buy-and-hold by size

❌ **Avoid small caps in bear markets**
- Worst drawdowns (-76%)
- Worst risk-adjusted losses (Sharpe: -4.98)
- Many coins with market cap $500M+ still went down significantly

## Methodology Notes

1. **Minimum Market Cap**: $500M filter eliminates extreme small/micro caps
2. **Buckets**: Quintiles recalculated at each annual snapshot based on qualified coins
3. **Returns**: Simple price returns between annual snapshots
4. **Sharpe Ratio**: Cross-sectional (dispersion across coins in bucket) as volatility proxy
5. **Filtering**: Removed stablecoins, wrapped tokens, and low-volume coins
6. **Survivorship Bias**: Only includes coins that existed in both snapshots

---

## Conclusion

**The crypto size premium is unstable and cycle-dependent**, unlike traditional equity markets:

1. **No consistent winner**: Different size buckets lead in different periods
2. **Best strategy**: **Bucket 2 near-large caps ($700M-$1B)** for risk-adjusted returns
3. **Most reliable**: **Bucket 1 ($500M-$700M)** for consistency
4. **Highest upside**: Mid-caps during bull markets, but with extreme volatility
5. **Key insight**: **Market cycle timing > Size factor** in crypto

**Recommended approach**: Focus on Bucket 2 for core holdings, tactical overweights to mid-caps (3-4) during confirmed bull markets, and avoid small caps during bear markets.
