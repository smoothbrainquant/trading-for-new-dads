## Executive Summary

The RoC vs Funding factor strategy was backtested across multiple configurations. The core hypothesis—that the spread between Rate of Change (momentum) and cumulative funding rates provides predictive signal—**does not show strong evidence in the backtest results**.

### Key Findings

❌ **Hypothesis NOT Validated**: RoC-Funding spread shows very weak predictive power
- Best configuration: 14-day window achieved only **1.54% total return** (0.02 Sharpe)
- Most configurations: Near-zero or negative returns
- High volatility (50-70% annualized) with minimal returns = poor risk-adjusted performance
- No configuration achieved Sharpe ratio > 0.05

|---------------|--------|--------------|---------------|--------|--------|----------|
| **Best: 14d Window** | 14d | **+1.54%** | **1.27%** | **0.02** | -29.16% | 52.05% |
| 30d Baseline | 30d | +0.51% | 0.44% | 0.01 | -32.30% | 51.32% |
| 60d Window | 60d | +1.28% | 1.18% | 0.02 | -24.82% | 49.49% |
| Spread-Weighted | 30d | +0.56% | 0.49% | 0.01 | -31.78% | 51.56% |
| Long-Only High Spread | 30d | **-0.37%** | -0.33% | -0.00 | -29.13% | 49.64% |
| Contrarian (Long Low/Short High) | 30d | **-0.44%** | -0.38% | -0.01 | -25.11% | 48.68% |
| Lower Filters (More Symbols) | 30d | +0.86% | 0.21% | 0.00 | **-76.88%** | 51.41% |

## 1. Methodology

### Strategy Overview

The RoC-Funding factor compares price momentum (RoC) versus cumulative funding costs:

**Signal Calculation:**
```
RoC = (Price_t - Price_t-N) / Price_t-N × 100
Cumulative Funding = Sum of daily funding rates over N days
Spread = RoC - Cumulative Funding
```

**Trading Logic:**
- **Long**: Coins with highest spread (RoC >> Funding) → Momentum underpriced
- **Short**: Coins with lowest spread (RoC << Funding) → Funding overload
- **Hypothesis**: Markets should correct these inefficiencies

### Data Sources

- **Price Data**: 172 symbols from combined Coinbase/CoinMarketCap daily data
- **Funding Data**: 90 symbols from Coinalyze historical funding rates (top 100)
- **Merged Universe**: 52 symbols with both price and funding data
- **Filtered Universe**: 22-45 symbols (depending on filters)
- **Period**: 2021-01-01 to 2025-10-27 (1,758 days)

### Backtest Parameters

**Default Configuration:**
- Window: 30 days
- Rebalance: Weekly (7 days)
- Weighting: Equal weight
- Allocation: 50% long, 50% short (market neutral)
- Min Volume: $5M (30d avg)

## 2. Detailed Results

### 2.1 Best Configuration: 14-Day Window

**Strategy**: Long High Spread, Short Low Spread  
**Window**: 14 days  
**Results**:
- Total Return: **+1.54%** (over ~4.8 years)
- Annualized Return: **1.27%**
- Sharpe Ratio: **0.02**
- Max Drawdown: **-29.16%**
- Win Rate: **52.05%**
- Avg Long Positions: 2.2
- Avg Short Positions: 1.2

**Interpretation:**
- Slightly positive but economically insignificant returns
- Sharpe ratio of 0.02 is essentially zero (no risk-adjusted edge)
- High volatility (57.55% annualized) for minimal returns
- Win rate barely above 50% (no predictive edge)

### 2.2 Baseline: 30-Day Window

**Results**:
- Total Return: **+0.51%**
- Annualized Return: **0.44%**
- Sharpe Ratio: **0.01**
- Max Drawdown: **-32.30%**
- Win Rate: **51.32%**

**Spread Statistics:**
- Mean Spread: -20.53%
- Median Spread: -22.31%
- Std Dev: 50.54%
- Range: -431.85% to +1,080.16%

**Key Observations:**
1. **Negative mean spread**: On average, RoC < Cumulative Funding
   - Suggests funding costs typically exceed price gains
   - Crypto perpetuals are expensive to hold long
2. **High variance**: Spreads are extremely noisy
   - Extreme outliers (+1,080% to -431%)
   - Signal is dominated by noise
3. **Weak ranking power**: Spread ranking doesn't predict future returns

### 2.3 60-Day Window

**Results**:
- Total Return: **+1.28%**
- Sharpe Ratio: **0.02**
- Max Drawdown: **-24.82%** (best)

**Interpretation:**
- Longer window = slightly more stable (lower drawdown)
- But still no economic significance
- Spread dispersion increases with window (-83.91% to +41.12%)

### 2.4 Strategy Variants

#### Long-Only High Spread
- Total Return: **-0.37%** (negative)
- Interpretation: High spread coins underperform on absolute basis
- Contradicts hypothesis that high spread = underpriced momentum

#### Contrarian (Long Low Spread, Short High Spread)
- Total Return: **-0.44%** (negative)
- Interpretation: Mean reversion in spreads also fails
- Neither momentum nor contrarian approach works

#### Spread-Weighted
- Total Return: **+0.56%** (similar to equal weight)
- Interpretation: Weighting by signal strength doesn't help
- Suggests signal quality is poor regardless of magnitude

### 2.5 Sensitivity Analysis

#### Lower Filters (More Symbols)
- Included 45 symbols vs 22 baseline
- Result: Worse performance (+0.86%, -76.88% max DD)
- Interpretation: Including smaller coins adds noise, not signal

#### Recent Period (2023-2025)
- Focused on most recent 2.5 years
- Result: Similar weak performance (+0.52%, 0.01 Sharpe)
- Interpretation: Strategy doesn't work in any sub-period

## 3. Why the Strategy Failed

### 3.1 Theoretical Issues

**Assumption 1: "RoC Should Outpace Funding"**
❌ **Invalid in Practice**
- Funding rates reflect leverage demand, not just price expectations
- High funding can persist during strong trends (both justified)
- Low funding doesn't necessarily signal underpriced momentum

**Assumption 2: "Extreme Spreads Mean Revert"**
❌ **No Evidence**
- Spreads are highly path-dependent
- Can stay extreme for extended periods
- No reliable reversion pattern observed

**Assumption 3: "Spread Contains Predictive Information"**
❌ **Not Supported**
- Win rate ~51% (essentially random)
- Sharpe ratios ~0.01 (no risk-adjusted edge)
- High volatility suggests noise dominates signal

### 3.2 Market Reality

**Funding Rate Dynamics:**
1. **Leverage Demand**: Funding reflects current positioning, not future returns
2. **Momentum Costs**: Strong trends often have high funding (both justified)
3. **Liquidity Premium**: Smaller coins have wider funding spreads (noise)
4. **Exchange Heterogeneity**: Funding varies across exchanges (we used aggregated)

**Price-Funding Relationship:**
- **During Bull Markets**: High RoC + High Funding (both positive)
- **During Bear Markets**: Negative RoC + Variable Funding (unstable)
- **Sideways Markets**: Low RoC + Moderate Funding (no edge)
- **Result**: No consistent exploitable pattern

### 3.3 Data Quality Issues

1. **Limited Universe**: Only 22-52 symbols with both price and funding data
2. **Survivor Bias**: Funding data available mainly for successful coins
3. **Data Gaps**: 61.3% of rows missing funding data initially
4. **Funding Aggregation**: Daily averages may miss intraday dynamics

## 4. Statistical Analysis

### 4.1 Signal Quality Metrics

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Win Rate | 51.32% | No better than coin flip |
| Sharpe Ratio | 0.01 | Essentially zero risk-adjusted return |
| Information Ratio | ~0.02 | No alpha vs random portfolio |
| Spread Mean | -20.53% | Negative average (funding > RoC) |
| Spread Std | 50.54% | High noise relative to signal |
| Signal-to-Noise | 0.4 | Very weak signal |

### 4.2 Turnover and Costs

- Average positions: 2-3 longs, 1-2 shorts
- Rebalances: 59-247 times (depending on configuration)
- Estimated turnover: 30-50% per rebalance
- Trading costs (assumed 0.1% per trade): ~0.5-1% per year
- **Result**: Transaction costs likely eliminate any small edge

### 4.3 Correlation Analysis

**Portfolio Correlation to BTC** (estimated from trades):
- Long portfolio: Positive correlation to BTC (~0.3-0.5)
- Short portfolio: Negative correlation to BTC
- Net portfolio: Near-zero correlation (market neutral achieved)

**Implication**: Strategy is effectively random relative to market direction

## 5. Comparison to Other Factors

### Performance vs Existing Factors

| Factor | Sharpe | Annual Return | Max DD | Status |
|--------|--------|---------------|--------|--------|
| **Beta Factor (BAB)** | **0.72** | **28.85%** | -40.86% | ✅ Works |
| **Momentum Factor** | ~0.8-1.2 | 20-40% | -30-50% | ✅ Works |
| **Size Factor** | ~0.5-0.8 | 15-25% | -25-40% | ✅ Works |
| **RoC-Funding Factor** | **0.01** | **0.44%** | -32.30% | ❌ Fails |

**Key Insight**: RoC-Funding factor is one of the weakest factors tested

### Why Other Factors Work But This Doesn't

1. **Beta Factor**: Measures systematic risk (stable characteristic)
2. **Momentum Factor**: Captures behavioral persistence (documented anomaly)
3. **Size Factor**: Reflects liquidity premium (structural advantage)
4. **RoC-Funding**: Measures transient relationship (no structural edge)

## 6. Key Learnings

### What We Learned

✅ **Positive Findings**:
1. Funding data successfully integrated with price data
2. Backtest framework works correctly (no lookahead bias)
3. Spread calculation is technically correct
4. Market neutral construction achieved

❌ **Negative Findings**:
1. RoC-Funding spread has no predictive power
2. Neither momentum nor contrarian approach works
3. Strategy fails across all time periods tested
4. More symbols or different windows don't help
5. Funding costs typically exceed price gains (mean spread = -20%)

### Theoretical Implications

**Why "RoC Should Outpace Funding" Fails:**

1. **Funding Reflects Positioning, Not Forecast**:
   - High funding = many longs positioned (already in trend)
   - Low funding = few longs (may be for good reason)
   - Funding is contemporaneous indicator, not leading

2. **Momentum and Carry Are Separate Factors**:
   - Momentum (RoC) works independently
   - Carry (funding) works independently
   - Their difference doesn't add information

3. **Efficient Markets (Partially)**:
   - Extreme spreads quickly arbitraged away
   - Professional traders ensure funding reflects fair value
   - Retail inefficiencies too small/transient to exploit

## 7. Recommendations

### 7.1 Strategy Assessment

**Verdict**: ❌ **NOT RECOMMENDED FOR TRADING**

**Reasons**:
1. Returns insufficient to cover transaction costs
2. High volatility with no risk-adjusted edge
3. No theoretical justification for observed failure
4. More robust factors available (Beta, Momentum, Size)

### 7.2 Alternative Approaches

If interested in funding rate strategies, consider:

**Option 1: Pure Funding Rate Factor**
- Trade purely on funding rate levels (not spread)
- Short high funding coins (expensive to be long)
- Existing "Carry" strategy already does this

**Option 2: Pure Momentum Factor**
- Trade purely on RoC (not spread with funding)
- Momentum factors have proven track record
- Simpler and more robust

**Option 3: Funding Rate Mean Reversion**
- Trade extreme funding rates reverting to mean
- Short-term strategy (intraday to few days)
- Different time horizon than tested here

**Option 4: Multi-Factor Model**
- Combine Beta + Momentum + Size factors
- RoC-Funding doesn't add value to this mix
- Focus on factors with proven alpha

### 7.3 Future Research Directions

If continuing research on RoC-Funding relationship:

1. **Shorter Time Horizons**:
   - Test intraday or 1-3 day holding periods
   - Funding adjusts faster than tested here
   - May find short-term mean reversion

2. **Exchange-Specific Analysis**:
   - Don't use aggregated funding (loses information)
   - Test per-exchange funding vs price
   - May find exchange-specific inefficiencies

3. **Regime-Dependent Models**:
   - Strategy may work in specific market regimes
   - Test separately in bull/bear/sideways markets
   - Use BTC trend as regime filter

4. **Nonlinear Relationships**:
   - Spread may have nonlinear predictive power
   - Test machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
   - May capture complex interactions

5. **Funding Rate Shocks**:
   - Focus on sudden funding spikes/drops
   - Test event-driven approach (not periodic rebalancing)
   - May find short-lived dislocations

## 8. Conclusion

The RoC vs Funding factor backtest demonstrates that **the spread between rate of change and cumulative funding rates does not provide a reliable trading signal** in cryptocurrency markets over the tested period (2021-2025).

### Summary of Findings

- ❌ **Performance**: Near-zero returns (0.44% annualized)
- ❌ **Risk-Adjusted**: Sharpe ratio of 0.01 (no edge)
- ❌ **Consistency**: Fails across all configurations tested
- ❌ **Economic Significance**: Returns below transaction costs

### Hypothesis Verdict

**Original Hypothesis**: "RoC should outpace funding in efficient markets. Deviations signal trading opportunities."

**Verdict**: **REJECTED**

**Evidence**:
1. Mean spread is negative (-20.53%), not zero
2. Extreme spreads do not reliably mean-revert
3. High spread coins do not outperform low spread coins
4. Win rate is 51% (no predictive power)

### Final Recommendation

**Do NOT use this strategy for live trading.** Focus instead on:
- Beta Factor (BAB) - Proven track record (Sharpe 0.72)
- Pure Momentum - Strong historical performance
- Pure Carry - Funding rates alone may have value
- Multi-factor models - Combine proven factors

The RoC-Funding spread appears to be a **weak to non-existent factor** in crypto markets. This finding itself is valuable—it tells us what **doesn't** work and helps focus research on more promising strategies.
