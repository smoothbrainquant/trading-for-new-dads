- Annualized Return: **+4.14%**
- Annualized Volatility: 28.25%
- Sharpe Ratio: **0.15**
- Sortino Ratio: 0.14
- Maximum Drawdown: **-44.39%**
- Calmar Ratio: 0.09

**Trading Statistics:**
- Win Rate: 20.73%

- ‚úÖ Lower exposure (vs mean reversion) controlled risk

---

### 2. Trend Following Premium (Risk Parity)

**Strategy:** Same as above, but with risk-adjusted weighting

**Performance:**
- Total Return: **+10.54%** (10.2pp worse than EW)
- Annualized Return: +2.18%
- Annualized Volatility: 27.36% (slightly lower)
- Sharpe Ratio: 0.08 (worse)
- Maximum Drawdown: -45.81% (worse)

**Key Difference:**
- Risk parity reduced returns without meaningfully reducing risk
- Equal weight allocation was more effective for this strategy
- Lower gross exposure (58% vs 63%) reduced profit potential

---

### 3. Mean Reversion Premium (Equal Weight) ‚ùå FAILED

**Strategy:** Long low ADF (stationary), Short high ADF (trending)

**Performance:**
- Total Return: **-42.93%** (massive underperformance)
- Annualized Return: **-11.36%**
- Annualized Volatility: 28.25%
- Sharpe Ratio: **-0.40** (negative)
- Sortino Ratio: -0.34

- Avg Short ADF: -1.34 (trending)
- ADF Spread: 1.11 (large spread)

**Exposure:**
- Much lower exposure: only $2,602 gross (26%)
- Suggests fewer coins passed filters

**Why It Failed:**
- ‚ùå Stationary coins significantly underperformed
- ‚ùå Mean reversion did NOT work in this period
- ‚ùå Trending coins continued trending (momentum)
- ‚ùå Betting against trend was costly
- ‚ùå 2021-2025 was NOT a mean-reverting market

---

### 4. Long Stationary Only ‚ùå WORST PERFORMER

**Strategy:** Long-only on stationary coins (defensive)

**Performance:**
- Total Return: **-77.28%** (catastrophic)
- Annualized Return: **-27.28%**
- Sharpe Ratio: **-0.74**
- Maximum Drawdown: **-84.22%** (near total loss)

**Why It Failed:**
- ‚ùå No hedge via shorts
- ‚ùå Full directional exposure to underperforming coins
- ‚ùå Stationary coins collapsed during downturns
- ‚ùå Only $920 average exposure (ran out of valid coins)

**Key Insight:** Stationary/mean-reverting coins were the WORST performers over this period.

---

### 5. Long Trending Only

**Strategy:** Long-only on trending coins

**Performance:**
- Total Return: **-66.13%** (very poor)
- Annualized Return: **-20.76%**
- Sharpe Ratio: **-0.58**
- Maximum Drawdown: **-67.02%**

**Why It Failed:**
- ‚ùå No hedge via shorts
- ‚ùå Full directional exposure
- ‚ùå Trending coins also suffered in bear markets
- ‚ùå Better than stationary, but still terrible without hedging

**Key Insight:** Even trending coins need hedging. Long/short structure critical.

## Market Regime Analysis

### Period Breakdown

The 2021-2025 period included multiple distinct market regimes:

#### 1. Q1 2021 - Q4 2021: Bull Market Peak
- Crypto hit all-time highs (BTC ~$69k in Nov 2021)
- High momentum, trending behavior dominant
- Mean reversion failed in strong uptrend

#### 2. 2022: Bear Market Collapse
- Terra/LUNA collapse (May 2022)
- FTX collapse (Nov 2022)
- BTC fell from $69k to $16k (-77%)
- Trending coins fell less than stationary coins

#### 3. 2023: Recovery & Consolidation
- Sideways consolidation
- Gradual recovery
- Mix of trending and mean-reverting behavior

#### 4. 2024 - Q3 2025: Bull Market Resume
- Bitcoin ETF approval (Jan 2024)
- New highs in 2024-2025
- Momentum/trending behavior dominant again

**Overall Character:** The period was dominated by strong directional moves (both up and down), favoring momentum/trending over mean reversion.

---

## Why Trend Following Won

### 1. Momentum Dominated the Period
- Strong bull runs (2021, 2024-2025)
- Trending coins captured sustained moves
- Mean reversion strategies fought the trend

### 2. Stationary Coins Were Low-Growth
- Low ADF = mean-reverting = range-bound
- These coins lacked catalysts
- Investors preferred growth/momentum coins

### 3. Short Side Provided Crucial Hedge
- Shorting stationary coins offset losses
- Market neutral structure worked well
- Long-only strategies had no protection

### 4. Equal Weight Outperformed Risk Parity
- Risk parity over-weighted low-vol (stationary) coins
- These underperformed despite lower volatility
- Equal weight captured more upside from trending coins

## ADF Statistic Interpretation

### Average ADF Values by Performance

| Category | Avg ADF | Interpretation | Performance |
|----------|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Stationary (Long in MR) | -2.45 | Very mean-reverting | **Worst** |
| Moderate Stationary | -1.23 | Somewhat mean-reverting | Poor |
| Trending (Long in TF) | -0.78 | Non-stationary/trending | **Best** |

**Key Finding:** More negative ADF (more stationary) = worse performance in this period.

### Stationarity Rate
- Only 10.4% of coin-days were stationary (p < 0.05)
- Most crypto prices are non-stationary (random walk/trending)
- This is expected in emerging, high-growth markets

## Portfolio Composition Analysis

### Number of Positions Over Time

| Strategy | Avg Long | Avg Short | Total |
|----------|----------|-----------|-------|
| Trend Following (EW) | 1.1 | 0.7 | 1.8 |
| Mean Reversion (EW) | 0.7 | 1.1 | 1.8 |
| Long Stationary | 0.7 | 0.0 | 0.7 |
| Long Trending | 1.1 | 0.0 | 1.1 |

**Observations:**
- Very few positions passed filters (avg < 2 coins!)
- Top 100 market cap + volume filters + ADF ranking = thin universe
- Mean Reversion had fewer long positions (stationary coins scarce)
- Trend Following had more long positions (trending more common)

**Implication:** Strategy was highly concentrated (1-2 positions). High idiosyncratic risk.

## Win Rate Analysis

**All Strategies Had Low Win Rates (20-23%)**

| Strategy | Win Rate |
|----------|----------|
| Trend Following (EW) | 20.73% |
| Trend Following (RP) | 21.20% |
| Long Trending | 21.55% |
| Long Stationary | 21.50% |
| Mean Reversion (EW) | 22.73% |

**Key Insights:**
1. **Win rate is NOT predictive of profitability**
   - Trend Following won despite 20.73% win rate
   - Positive skew: Few big wins > many small losses

2. **All strategies lost money on most days**
   - ~80% of days were losing days
   - Success came from magnitude of wins vs losses

3. **Mean Reversion had highest win rate but worst returns**
   - More frequent small wins
   - Occasional catastrophic losses overwhelmed

| Long Trending | $1,367 | $1,367 | 13.7% |
| Long Stationary | $920 | $920 | 9.2% |

**Key Findings:**
1. **Mean Reversion deployed much less capital** (26% vs 63%)
   - Fewer coins met criteria
   - Suggests stationary coins are rare in top 100

2. **Long-only strategies severely undercapitalized** (<15%)
   - Most capital sat idle
   - Couldn't find enough qualifying coins

3. **Trend Following fully utilized capital** (63%)
   - More trending coins available
   - Better diversification

   - Bear/sideways ‚Üí Mean Reversion (if it works)

5. **Optimize ADF Parameters**
   - Test 30d, 90d, 120d windows
   - Test different regression types
   - Test different percentile thresholds

### For Risk Management

1. **Position Size Limits**
   - Cap individual positions (currently no limit)
   - Prevent over-concentration

2. **Stop Losses**
   - Add protection against extreme moves
   - Currently holds through drawdowns

3. **Leverage Control**
   - Consider reducing gross exposure in high vol periods
   - Dynamic risk budgeting

4. **Transaction Cost Modeling**
