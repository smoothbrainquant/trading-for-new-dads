# Beta Factor Backtest Results

**Date:** 2025-10-27  
**Backtest Period:** 2021-04-01 to 2025-10-24 (1,668 trading days, ~4.6 years)  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Executive Summary

The beta factor strategy tests whether cryptocurrencies with different systematic risk exposures to Bitcoin exhibit predictable return patterns. We implemented and backtested four strategy variants:

1. **Betting Against Beta (BAB)** - Long low beta, short high beta
2. **Traditional Risk Premium** - Long high beta, short low beta
3. **Long Low Beta** - Defensive long-only
4. **Long High Beta** - Aggressive long-only

### Key Findings

✅ **The "Betting Against Beta" (BAB) anomaly EXISTS in crypto markets**

- **BAB Strategy**: +177.66% total return, 25.04% annualized (equal weight)
- **BAB with Risk Parity**: +218.47% total return, 28.85% annualized (BEST PERFORMER)
- **Traditional Risk Premium**: -82.35% total return (FAILED - opposite of BAB works)
- **Low beta coins significantly outperform high beta coins on risk-adjusted basis**

This confirms that, similar to traditional equity markets, leverage constraints and behavioral biases lead to overvaluation of high-beta cryptocurrencies.

## Beta Distribution Analysis

### Beta Statistics (90-day rolling window)

```
Total data points with beta: 70,502
Beta range:                  [-0.58, 4.35]
Beta mean:                   1.23
Beta median:                 1.15

Filtering (volume > $5M, mcap > $50M):
Coins before filtering:      172
Coins after filtering:       52
```

### Beta Quintiles

**Low Beta Portfolio (Long positions):**
- Average Beta: 0.99
- Interpretation: Coins move nearly 1:1 with BTC (slightly defensive)
- Examples: ZRX, ALGO, ADA, XLM

**High Beta Portfolio (Short positions):**
- Average Beta: 1.84
- Interpretation: Coins are 84% more volatile than BTC
- Examples: GRT, EOS, CRV, STORJ

### Findings:
1. Most cryptos have beta > 1 (more volatile than BTC)
2. Few truly defensive cryptos exist (beta < 0.5)
3. High beta coins (>1.5) consistently underperform
4. Beta spread is wide enough to extract alpha

## Why Does BAB Work in Crypto?

### 1. Leverage Constraints
- Retail investors dominate crypto markets
- Many can't access leverage or don't use it efficiently
- Instead, they buy high-beta coins for "lottery ticket" exposure
- This drives up prices of high-beta coins beyond fair value

### 2. Behavioral Biases
- **Attention Bias**: High-volatility coins attract more attention
- **Overconfidence**: Retail investors prefer exciting, volatile assets
- **Lottery Preference**: Preference for positive skewness and high upside

### 3. Market Microstructure
- High-beta coins often have:
  - Lower liquidity
  - Higher trading costs
  - More extreme price movements
  - Higher correlation to market crashes

### 4. Institutional Absence
- Professional investors who would arbitrage away the anomaly are limited
- Less efficient market pricing
- Behavioral biases persist longer

## Portfolio Construction Details

### Position Selection Process

**Weekly Rebalancing (every 7 days):**

1. **Calculate Beta** (90-day rolling window)
   - For each coin: Beta = Cov(R_coin, R_BTC) / Var(R_BTC)
   - Minimum 63 days data required (70% of window)

2. **Filter Universe**
   - Volume: 30-day avg > $5M
   - Market cap: > $50M
   - Valid beta (not NaN, between -5 and 10)

3. **Rank by Beta**
   - Sort all coins by beta (low to high)
   - Calculate percentile rank

4. **Select Positions**
   - **Long**: Bottom 20% (lowest beta)
   - **Short**: Top 20% (highest beta)

5. **Calculate Weights**
   - **Equal Weight**: 1/N within each bucket
   - **Risk Parity**: Weight ∝ 1/Volatility

6. **Allocate Capital**
   - 50% to long side
   - 50% to short side
   - Market neutral (net exposure = 0)

### No-Lookahead Bias Prevention

✅ Signals generated on day T use returns from day T+1
- Beta calculated using only past data
- Positions taken at close of day T
- Returns from day T+1 used for P&L
- Proper `.shift(-1)` alignment

### Key Insights:

1. **BAB is among the best performing factors**
   - Highest total return (+218.5% with risk parity)
   - Competitive Sharpe ratio (0.72)
   - Similar drawdown to other factors

2. **Traditional risk premium completely fails**
   - Confirms CAPM doesn't work in crypto
   - Opposite strategy (BAB) is profitable

3. **Market neutral strategies work well**
   - Low correlation to BTC
   - Positive returns in multiple market regimes

4. **Risk parity weighting adds value**
   - 23% higher returns vs equal weight
   - Better risk-adjusted performance

---

## Market Regime Analysis

### By Market Conditions:

**Bull Markets (BTC > 200d MA):**
- BAB still profitable but underperforms long-only strategies
- High beta coins participate in rallies
- Lower alpha spread between low/high beta

**Bear Markets (BTC < 200d MA):**
- BAB excels: low beta coins hold value better
- High beta coins crash harder
- Short side contributes significantly to returns

**High Volatility Periods:**
- Beta spread widens
- More alpha opportunity
- Higher drawdowns but higher returns

**Low Volatility Periods:**
- Beta spread narrows
- Lower alpha opportunity
- More stable returns

---

## Risk Considerations

### Identified Risks:

1. **Beta Instability**
   - Beta can change rapidly during market shocks
   - Solution: 90-day window provides stability

2. **Limited Long Opportunities**
   - Average only 1.2 long positions (few low-beta coins)
   - More short opportunities (2.1 positions)
   - Universe concentration risk

3. **Liquidity Risk**
   - Low beta coins may be less liquid
   - Higher slippage on rebalancing
   - Solution: Volume filters help

4. **Regime Dependency**
   - Underperforms in strong bull markets
   - Excels in bear markets and consolidation

5. **Funding Costs**
   - Shorting can be expensive (futures funding)
   - Not modeled in backtest
   - Real costs may reduce returns by 5-10% annually

---

## Parameter Sensitivity

### Beta Window Tested:
- **30 days**: Too noisy, high turnover
- **60 days**: Better stability
- **90 days**: ✅ Optimal (baseline)
- **180 days**: Too slow to adapt

### Rebalancing Frequency:
- **Daily**: High turnover, transaction costs
- **Weekly (7d)**: ✅ Optimal balance
- **Bi-weekly (14d)**: Lower turnover, similar returns
- **Monthly (30d)**: Misses opportunities, lower returns

### Weighting Method:
- **Equal Weight**: Simple, 177.7% return
- **Risk Parity**: ✅ Best, 218.5% return
- **Beta Weighted**: Unstable, not recommended
