## Executive Summary

### What We Discovered

**The skew factor strategy works, but NOT as expected:**

1. ‚ùå **Mean reversion hypothesis FAILED**
   - Buying negative skewness (crash risk) loses money (-15.21%)
   - Coins in distress continue declining

2. ‚úÖ **Momentum/correction hypothesis CONFIRMED**
   - Shorting positive skewness (euphoria) makes money (+116.88%)
   - Overextended coins correct

3. üéØ **Diversification effect VALIDATED**
   - Long/short has 70% lower volatility than short-only
   - Even a losing long portfolio improves risk-adjusted returns
   - Sharpe ratio: 0.36 (long/short) vs 0.27 (short-only)

### Key Insight

**Skewness is a momentum indicator, not a mean reversion signal.**

Negative skewness = Recent extreme losses = Continued decline  
Positive skewness = Recent extreme gains = Correction/underperformance

## Strategy Comparison

### Long/Short Strategy (Original)

**Structure:**
- Long: Bottom quintile (most negative skewness)
- Short: Top quintile (most positive skewness)
- Equal weight, dollar neutral (100% long, 100% short)

**Results:**
- Return: +83.88% (+11.38% annualized)
- Sharpe: 0.36
- Max DD: -54.37%
- Volatility: 31.67%

**Pros:**
‚úÖ Better risk-adjusted returns  
‚úÖ Lower volatility  
‚úÖ Smaller drawdown  
‚úÖ Market-neutral exposure  

**Cons:**
‚ùå Lower absolute returns  
‚ùå Long side loses money  
‚ùå More complex implementation  

### Short-Only Strategy

**Structure:**
- Short: Top quintile (most positive skewness)
- Cash: No long positions
- 100% short exposure

**Results:**
- Return: +116.88% (+14.68% annualized)
- Sharpe: 0.27
- Max DD: -66.63%
- Volatility: 53.75%

**Pros:**
‚úÖ Higher absolute returns (+39%)  
‚úÖ Simpler implementation  
‚úÖ Lower turnover (2.39% vs 5.68%)  
‚úÖ Fewer positions to manage  

**Cons:**
‚ùå Much higher volatility (+70%)  
‚ùå Worse drawdown (-66% vs -54%)  
‚ùå Lower Sharpe ratio  
‚ùå Bearish market exposure

## Recommendation by Investor Type

### üèõÔ∏è Conservative/Institutional ‚Üí **Long/Short**

**Use if you:**
- Have strict risk mandates (e.g., max 40% drawdown)
- Prioritize Sharpe ratio over absolute returns
- Want lower volatility (31.67% acceptable)
- Prefer market-neutral strategies
- Manage institutional capital

**Expected Performance:**
- 8-12% annualized after costs
- Sharpe 0.3-0.4
- Max DD around -50%

### üöÄ Aggressive/Personal Capital ‚Üí **Short-Only at 50% Leverage**

**Use if you:**
- Can tolerate -60% drawdowns
- Want higher absolute returns
- Have high volatility tolerance
- Prefer simpler implementation
- Running personal capital with aggressive goals

**Expected Performance:**
- 10-15% annualized after costs
- Sharpe 0.25-0.30
- Max DD around -60%

**Why 50% leverage?**
- Matches long/short risk profile (volatility)
- Maintains higher return potential
- Reduces drawdown from -66% to ~-40%
- Best risk/reward balance

### üéØ Optimal Approach ‚Üí **Hybrid/Dynamic**

**Best of both worlds:**
1. Run short-only at 50% capital (not 100%)
2. Use long/short during high volatility regimes
3. Switch to short-only during trending markets
4. Requires regime detection model

## Real-World Considerations

### Transaction Costs

**Long/Short:**
- Turnover: 5.68% daily ‚Üí ~2.5% annual drag
- Net return: ~8.9% annualized

**Short-Only:**
- Turnover: 2.39% daily ‚Üí ~0.9% annual drag
- Net return: ~13.8% annualized

### Funding Rates (Perpetual Swaps)

**Cost for shorting:**
- Average funding: 0.01-0.05% daily
- Annual cost: 3.6-18% on short exposure
- At 21.8% exposure: 0.8-4% annual drag

**Adjusted returns:**
- Long/Short: ~8.9% (no change, balanced)
- Short-Only: ~9.8-13% (after funding)

**Conclusion:** After real costs, strategies are roughly equivalent (8-13% annualized).

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Immediate Deployment (If Proceeding)

**Option A: Long/Short**
```
Allocation: 40% of portfolio
Leverage: 1.0x
Rebalance: Daily
Expected: 4-5% portfolio contribution, 0.36 Sharpe
Max acceptable DD: -20% (50% of -40% at 40% allocation)
```

**Option B: Short-Only (50% Leverage)**
```
Allocation: 50% of portfolio at 0.5x leverage  
= 25% gross short exposure
Rebalance: Daily
Expected: 3-7% portfolio contribution, 0.27 Sharpe
Max acceptable DD: -15% (50% of -30% at 50% allocation)
```

### Phase 2: Refinements (Week 1-2)

1. **Test decile approach**
   - Use top/bottom 10% instead of 20%
   - Increase position count
   - Reduce concentration risk

2. **Optimize lookback window**
   - Test 20d, 60d, 90d skewness
   - Find optimal parameter

3. **Add volume/momentum filters**
   - Combine with existing mean reversion signals
   - Filter out low-quality shorts

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimization (Week 3-4)

1. **Regime-dependent allocation**
   - Bull market: Lower short allocation
   - Bear market: Higher short allocation
   - Sideways: Full allocation

2. **Dynamic position sizing**
   - Weight by skewness magnitude
   - Risk parity approach
   - Volatility-adjusted

3. **Risk management overlays**
   - Stop losses on individual positions
   - Portfolio-level drawdown limits
   - Options for tail risk protection

## Risk Management Rules

### Position Limits
- Max single position: 5% of portfolio
- Max sector concentration: 20%
- Max total leverage: 2x

### Drawdown Controls
- **Yellow alert** at -20% portfolio drawdown
- **Red alert** at -30% portfolio drawdown
- **Halt trading** at -40% portfolio drawdown

### Rebalancing Rules

- Intraday monitoring for risk breaches
- No rebalancing during extreme volatility (>3 sigma moves)

## Conclusion

The skew factor strategy is **viable but requires refinement**:

‚úÖ **Profitable:** 83-117% total returns over 5.7 years  
‚úÖ **Robust:** Works across multiple market regimes  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Risky:** High volatility (32-54%) and drawdowns (54-67%)  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Asymmetric:** Only short side makes money  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Complex:** Needs sophisticated implementation  

**Recommendation:**
- **Conservative path:** Deploy long/short at 40% allocation
- **Aggressive path:** Deploy short-only at 50% leverage (25% net exposure)
- **Optimal path:** Start with long/short, transition to dynamic allocation after 6 months

**Expected contribution to portfolio:**
- 3-7% annual returns
- 0.25-0.35 Sharpe ratio
- Good diversification from other strategies

**Go/No-Go Decision:**
- **GO** if you have 6+ months to refine and high risk tolerance
- **NO-GO** if you need immediate deployment or have strict risk limits
- **WAIT** if you want more out-of-sample testing first
