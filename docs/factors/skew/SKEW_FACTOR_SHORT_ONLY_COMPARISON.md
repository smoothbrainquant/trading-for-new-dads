# Skew Factor Strategy - Long/Short vs Short-Only Comparison

**Date:** 2025-10-27  
**Backtest Period:** March 1, 2020 - October 24, 2025 (5.7 years)

---

## Executive Summary

The **short-only variant** generates **higher absolute returns** (+116.88%) but with **worse risk-adjusted performance** (Sharpe 0.27 vs 0.36). The original long/short strategy actually benefits from the diversification effect of holding both sides, despite the long side losing money.

| **Calmar Ratio** | 0.21 | 0.22 | üèÜ Short-Only (barely) |

### Key Insight
**The losing long portfolio acts as a volatility dampener, improving risk-adjusted returns despite negative contribution.**

## Portfolio Decomposition

### Long/Short Strategy

| Component | Contribution | % of Total | Sharpe |
|-----------|--------------|------------|--------|
| **Long Portfolio** | -15.21% | -18.1% | -0.06 |
| **Short Portfolio** | +116.88% | +139.3% | +0.25 |
| **Interaction/Diversification** | -17.79% | -21.2% | - |
| **Total** | +83.88% | 100% | 0.36 |

**Note:** Interaction effect is negative because both sides occasionally lose together.

## Volatility Analysis

### Why Short-Only Has Higher Volatility

**Long/Short Portfolio Variance:**
```
Var(L/S) = Var(Long) + Var(Short) - 2*Cov(Long, Short)
```

**If Long and Short are negatively correlated:**
- Covariance term reduces total variance
- Diversification benefit even if one side loses money

**Evidence:**
- Long/Short vol: 31.67%
- Short-Only vol: 53.75%
- **Volatility reduction:** 41% lower with long/short

**Interpretation:**
The long portfolio (negative skew coins) and short portfolio (positive skew coins) have offsetting volatilities. When shorts lose (coins with positive skew rally), longs often gain (negative skew coins also rally). This negative correlation reduces overall portfolio volatility.

## Drawdown Comparison

### Maximum Drawdown Events

| Strategy | Max Drawdown | Date Range | Duration | Recovery |
|----------|--------------|------------|----------|----------|
| **Long/Short** | -54.37% | Estimated 2021-2022 | ~months | Partial |
| **Short-Only** | -66.63% | Estimated 2021-2022 | ~months | Yes |

**Short-only drawdown is 23% worse** (-66.63% vs -54.37%)

**Why?**
- During crypto bull runs (2021, 2024-2025), shorts get crushed
- No long portfolio to offset losses
- Pure directional bet against positive skewness

**Risk Implication:**
A -66% drawdown requires +191% gain to recover. This is psychologically and practically difficult to stomach.

## Risk-Adjusted Return Analysis

### Sharpe Ratio Breakdown

**Long/Short:**
- Sharpe = 0.36
- Return per unit risk = 0.36
- More efficient use of volatility

**Short-Only:**
- Sharpe = 0.27
- Return per unit risk = 0.27
- **25% less efficient** than long/short

### Return-to-Drawdown Ratio

**Long/Short:**
- Return / Max DD = 11.38% / 54.37% = 0.209
- Calmar = 0.21

**Short-Only:**
- Return / Max DD = 14.68% / 66.63% = 0.220
- Calmar = 0.22

**Verdict:** Virtually identical Calmar ratios (0.21 vs 0.22)

## When to Use Each Strategy

### Use Long/Short If:
‚úÖ You prioritize risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio)  
‚úÖ You have strict drawdown limits (e.g., -40% max)  
‚úÖ You want lower volatility (31.67% vs 53.75%)  
‚úÖ You prefer market-neutral exposure  
‚úÖ You value consistency over absolute returns  
‚úÖ You're running institutional capital with risk mandates

### Use Short-Only If:
‚úÖ You prioritize absolute returns over risk-adjusted  
‚úÖ You can tolerate -66% drawdowns  
‚úÖ You have high volatility tolerance  
‚úÖ You're bearish on crypto market structure  
‚úÖ You want simpler implementation (one side only)  
‚úÖ You're running personal capital with aggressive goals

## Practical Considerations

### Transaction Costs Impact

**Long/Short:**
- Turnover: 5.68% daily
- Gross exposure: 43.6%
- Cost at 0.1% fees: ~2.5% annual drag
- **Net return after fees:** ~8.9% annualized

**Short-Only:**
- Turnover: 2.39% daily
- Gross exposure: 21.8%
- Cost at 0.1% fees: ~0.9% annual drag
- **Net return after fees:** ~13.8% annualized

**Advantage:** Short-only has lower transaction costs

### Shorting Costs (Funding Rates)

**Not modeled but important:**
- Perpetual swap funding rates average 0.01-0.05% daily
- Short positions pay longs during bull markets
- Can add 3.6-18% annual cost to short exposure
- **At 21.8% exposure:** 0.8-4% annual drag

**Adjusted short-only return:** 9.8-13% annualized (vs 8.9% for long/short)

**Advantage:** Roughly equivalent after real costs

### Implementation Complexity

**Long/Short:**
- More positions (0.8 long + 0.7 short)
- Requires both long and short execution
- More rebalancing (5.68% turnover)
- Market-neutral easier to manage

**Short-Only:**
- Fewer positions (0.7 short)
- Simpler execution (shorts only)
- Less rebalancing (2.39% turnover)
- But: requires margin, shorting infrastructure

**Advantage:** Short-only is simpler

## Statistical Significance

### Bootstrap Confidence Intervals (Conceptual)

**Long/Short 95% CI:**
- Return: 11.38% ¬± 8% ‚Üí [3.4%, 19.4%]
- Sharpe: 0.36 ¬± 0.15 ‚Üí [0.21, 0.51]

**Short-Only 95% CI:**
- Return: 14.68% ¬± 13% ‚Üí [1.7%, 27.7%]
- Sharpe: 0.27 ¬± 0.12 ‚Üí [0.15, 0.39]

**Overlap:** Significant overlap in confidence intervals suggests difference may not be statistically significant with more data.

## Recommendation

### Overall Winner: **DEPENDS ON RISK TOLERANCE**

### Conservative Investors ‚Üí **Long/Short**
- 33% less volatile
- Better Sharpe ratio (0.36 vs 0.27)
- 23% smaller drawdown (-54% vs -67%)
- More institutional-grade risk profile

### Aggressive Investors ‚Üí **Short-Only**
- 39% higher returns
- Simpler to implement
- Lower transaction costs
- Better for high-risk tolerance

### Optimal Approach: **Hybrid**
- **Run short-only at 50% capital** (instead of 100%)
- Achieve similar returns to long/short (~12-13%)
- With better Sharpe (scaled leverage)
- And lower implementation complexity
- **Best of both worlds**

### Alternative: **Dynamically Adjust**
- Use long/short in volatile markets (higher correlation)
- Use short-only in trending markets (lower correlation)
- Requires regime detection model

## Key Takeaways

### 1. Diversification Works Even With Losers
The long portfolio lost 15% but **reduced volatility by 41%**, improving risk-adjusted returns. This is a textbook example of diversification benefits.

### 2. Higher Returns ‚â† Better Strategy
Short-only has 39% more returns but 25% worse Sharpe. Risk-adjusted metrics matter for long-term sustainability.

### 3. Drawdown Is The Killer
-66% drawdown (short-only) vs -54% (long/short) is a huge psychological difference. Many traders would quit at -66%.

### 4. Real-World Costs Change The Picture
After accounting for funding rates and transaction costs, the strategies are roughly equivalent (8-13% annualized).

### 5. Simplicity Has Value
Short-only is much simpler to implement and manage. Sometimes operational efficiency trumps marginal performance gains.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. ‚úÖ Test short-only at 50% leverage (to match long/short risk)
2. ‚úÖ Analyze regime dependency (bull vs bear markets)
3. ‚úÖ Model funding rate costs explicitly
4. ‚úÖ Test decile approach (more positions)
5. ‚úÖ Out-of-sample validation

### Further Research
1. Combine with other factors (momentum, carry, mean reversion)
2. Dynamic allocation between long/short and short-only
3. Optimize position sizing (equal weight vs volatility-weighted)
4. Test options overlay for downside protection
5. Machine learning for entry/exit timing
