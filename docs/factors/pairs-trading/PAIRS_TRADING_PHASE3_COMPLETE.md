### Script Features

The `calc_basket_divergence_signals.py` script implements:

1. **Basket Return Calculation**
   - Equal-weight basket: Simple average of all coin returns
   - Market-cap-weighted basket: Weighted by market capitalization
   - Leave-one-out methodology: Each coin compared to basket excluding itself

2. **Divergence Metrics**
   - **Z-score Divergence:** Rolling 60-day z-score of coin vs basket relative performance
   - **Percentile Rank:** 20-day cumulative return percentile within basket
   - **Correlation:** Rolling 60-day correlation between coin and basket

3. **Signal Generation Rules**
   - **LONG Signal (Underperformer):**
     - Z-score < -1.5 (significantly underperformed)
     - Percentile rank < 25th percentile
     - Correlation with basket > 0.3
   - **SHORT Signal (Outperformer):**
     - Z-score > 1.5 (significantly outperformed)
     - Percentile rank > 75th percentile
     - Correlation with basket > 0.3

4. **Filters Applied**
   - **Liquidity:** Min 30-day avg volume > $5M
   - **Market Cap:** Min market cap > $50M
   - **Volatility:** Max 30-day volatility < 150% annualized
   - **Data Quality:** Min 90 days of continuous data
   - **Correlation:** Min correlation with basket > 0.3

5. **Output Formats**
   - Full historical signals with all metrics
   - Current signals (most recent date)
   - Category-level summary statistics

## Key Findings

### 1. Signal Asymmetry: More SHORT than LONG

**SHORT signals:** 232 (94.7% of active signals)  
**LONG signals:** 13 (5.3% of active signals)

**Possible Explanations:**
- **Bull market bias:** Coins tend to outperform their baskets during rallies
- **Momentum persistence:** Winners keep winning (slower mean reversion)
- **Threshold asymmetry:** May need different thresholds for LONG vs SHORT
- **Category composition:** Baskets may have "draggers" that underperform persistently

**Recommendation for Phase 4:**
- Test asymmetric thresholds (e.g., -2.0 for LONG, +1.5 for SHORT)
- Analyze LONG vs SHORT signal profitability separately
- Consider momentum strategies for outperformers

### 2. Category Performance Differences

**Meme Coins:**
- ‚úÖ Only category with balanced LONG signals (13 total)
- 11 symbols, 2,128 observations
- Higher volatility ‚Üí more divergences
- **Best candidate for pairs trading**

**Dino Coins:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Only SHORT signals (142 total)
- 5 symbols, 4,287 observations (longest history)
- Persistent underperformers may not mean-revert
- May need longer-term signals

**L1 Smart Contract & SOL Ecosystem:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Only SHORT signals (20 each)
- Small basket sizes (3-4 symbols)
- Less diverse, higher concentration risk

### 3. Filter Impact

**Symbol Attrition:**
- Initial: 172 symbols
- After data quality: 132 symbols (-23%)
- After liquidity: 67 symbols (-51%)
- After market cap: 47 symbols (-30%)
- After volatility: 45 symbols (-4%)

**Key Bottleneck:** Liquidity filter ($5M avg volume) eliminated 49% of symbols

**Recommendation:**
- Consider tiered filters for different basket sizes
- Lower threshold for less liquid categories (e.g., $2M for small baskets)
- Or accept higher concentration in large-cap coins

### 4. DeFi Blue Chips Missed

**Issue:** DeFi Blue Chips failed to generate signals (only 2 symbols passed filters)

**Affected Symbols:**
- Most DeFi tokens eliminated by liquidity or volatility filters
- Only AAVE, MKR may have passed (need verification)

**Recommendation for Phase 4:**
- Relax filters specifically for DeFi categories
- Or add more DeFi tokens to data collection
- Consider separate analysis for DeFi basket

## Data Quality Observations

### Symbol Coverage by Category

| Category | Symbols in Mapping | Symbols with Data | Coverage |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| Meme Coins | 13 | 11 | 85% |
| Dino Coins | 10 | 5 | 50% |
| DeFi Blue Chips | 13 | 2 | 15% ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| L1 Smart Contract | 24 | 4 | 17% ‚ö†Ô∏è |
| SOL Ecosystem | 6 | 3 | 50% |

**Key Issue:** Many categories have low symbol coverage after filters

### Recent Active Signals (Sample)

**Notable LONG signals:**
- 2025-10-20: GIGA (Meme Coins), z-score = -2.18
- 2025-10-11: MOG (Meme Coins), z-score = -2.83
- 2025-10-07: FARTCOIN (Meme Coins), z-score = -1.62
- 2025-09-19: FARTCOIN (Meme Coins), z-score = -2.35

**Notable SHORT signals:**
- 2025-10-20: FLOKI (Meme Coins), z-score = 5.04 üî•
- 2025-10-04: FLOKI (Meme Coins), z-score = 3.58
- 2025-10-03: FLOKI (Meme Coins), z-score = 5.37
- 2025-09-24: GIGA (Meme Coins), z-score = 5.08

**Insight:** FLOKI has been a persistent outperformer in Meme basket (multiple SHORT signals)

---

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Symbol Matching

**Issue Resolved:** Price data uses 'symbol' format ('BTC/USD') while category mappings use 'base' format ('BTC')

**Solution:** Script uses `base` column from price data for matching category symbols

### No-Lookahead Validation

**Critical for Phase 4 Backtesting:**
- Signals calculated using data up to and including day `t`
- Execution returns should be from day `t+1`
- Example:
  ```python
  signal_t = generate_signal(data[data.date <= t])
  return_t1 = data[data.date == t + 1]['return']
  pnl_t1 = signal_t * return_t1
  ```

### Performance Notes

**Execution Time:** ~10 seconds for all categories
**Memory Usage:** Efficient (processes one category at a time)
**Scalability:** Can handle 100+ symbols and 5+ years of data

---

## Signal Quality Assessment

### Strengths

‚úÖ **Comprehensive metrics:** Z-score, percentile rank, correlation  
‚úÖ **Strict filters:** Focus on liquid, tradable assets  
‚úÖ **Leave-one-out basket:** Avoids self-correlation bias  
‚úÖ **Long history:** Signals cover 2020-2025 (multiple market cycles)  
‚úÖ **Configurable:** Easy to adjust thresholds and filters

### Limitations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Signal sparsity:** Only 3.2% of observations have active signals  
‚ö†Ô∏è **LONG/SHORT imbalance:** 18:1 ratio (may indicate regime bias)  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Category coverage:** Only 4 categories generated signals  
‚ö†Ô∏è **No validation:** Signals not yet validated with backtest P&L  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Parameter sensitivity:** Single set of parameters (60d, 1.5 threshold)

### Recommended Improvements for Phase 4

1. **Asymmetric thresholds:** Test -2.0 for LONG, +1.5 for SHORT
2. **Multiple lookback windows:** Test 30d, 90d, 180d alongside 60d
3. **Dynamic thresholds:** Adjust by volatility regime
4. **Category-specific parameters:** Different thresholds per category
5. **Signal filtering:** Add momentum/trend filters to reduce false signals

## Next Steps: Phase 4 - Backtesting

### Immediate Actions (Week 3-4)

1. **Implement Backtest Script** (`backtests/scripts/backtest_basket_pairs_trading.py`)
   - Read signal file
   - Execute trades based on signals
   - Track positions and P&L
   - Calculate performance metrics

2. **Validate No-Lookahead Bias**
   - Ensure signals use `t` data, returns use `t+1` data
   - Test with simple example to verify

3. **Run Baseline Backtest**
   - Use default parameters (60d, 1.5 threshold, equal-weight)
   - Focus on Meme Coins first (highest signal quality)
   - Then test Dino Coins and other categories

4. **Generate Performance Reports**
   - Equity curve
   - Drawdown chart
   - Trade log
   - Performance metrics (Sharpe, win rate, turnover)

5. **Parameter Sensitivity Analysis**
   - Test multiple lookback windows (30d, 60d, 90d, 180d)
   - Test multiple thresholds (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5)
   - Test multiple holding periods (5d, 10d, 20d)
   - Compare equal-weight vs market-cap-weight baskets

### Success Criteria for Phase 4

‚úÖ **Phase 4 complete when:**
- Backtest produces equity curve and performance metrics
- No-lookahead bias validated
- Sharpe ratio > 0.5 (stretch goal: > 1.0)
- Win rate > 50%
- Max drawdown < 30%
- Comparison to buy-and-hold benchmark completed

## Risk Factors and Considerations

### 1. Signal Sparsity

**Issue:** Only 3.2% of observations have active signals (LONG or SHORT)

**Impact:**
- Low turnover strategy
- May miss opportunities
- Long periods with no trades

**Mitigation:**
- Lower signal threshold (1.0 instead of 1.5)
- Use multiple lookback windows
- Consider momentum overlays

### 2. SHORT Signal Dominance

**Issue:** 94.7% of active signals are SHORT (only 5.3% LONG)

**Impact:**
- Asymmetric strategy (mostly short-biased)
- May underperform in sustained bear markets
- Harder to maintain dollar-neutral portfolio

**Mitigation:**
- Use asymmetric thresholds
- Implement separate LONG and SHORT strategies
- Consider market regime filters

### 3. Category Coverage

**Issue:** Only 4 categories generated signals (DeFi Blue Chips failed)

**Impact:**
- Limited diversification across sectors
- Concentrated in Meme and Dino coins
- Miss DeFi and other opportunities

**Mitigation:**
- Relax filters for certain categories
- Add more coins to data collection
- Use tiered filter thresholds

### 4. Parameter Sensitivity

**Issue:** Only tested one parameter set (60d, 1.5 threshold)

**Impact:**
- Unknown if parameters are optimal
- May be overfitting to current regime
- Strategy may degrade with different parameters

**Mitigation:**
- Phase 4 parameter sensitivity analysis
- Walk-forward optimization
- Out-of-sample testing

### 5. Transaction Costs

**Issue:** Not yet modeled in signals

**Impact:**
- Real performance will be lower than backtest
- High-frequency signals may be unprofitable after costs
- Slippage on low-liquidity coins

**Mitigation:**
- Phase 4 should include realistic transaction costs (10-50 bps)
- Filter out low-liquidity signals
- Model slippage based on volume
