## 🏆 Performance by Regime

### 1. Strong Up Markets (>10% BTC 5d change)

**Duration:** 118 days (6.9% of time)  
**Avg BTC 5d Change:** +14.1%

| Strategy | Ann. Return | Sharpe | Max DD | Win Rate |
|----------|-------------|--------|--------|----------|
| **Trend Following (RP)** | **+113.4%** | **4.17** | **-7.1%** | **23.7%** |
| **Trend Following (EW)** | **+87.6%** | **3.49** | **-7.0%** | **23.7%** |
| Mean Reversion (EW) | **-46.7%** | -1.87 | -19.4% | 15.3% |

**Analysis:**
- ✅ **Trend Following CRUSHES** strong up markets
- ✅ 113% annualized return (Risk Parity version)
- ✅ Sharpe ratio of 4.17 (exceptional!)
- ✅ Very low drawdown (-7%)
- ❌ **Mean Reversion FAILS** badly (-46% annualized)
- ❌ Low win rate for Mean Reversion (15%)

**Why?**
- Strong uptrends → Trending coins (high ADF) explode higher
- Stationary coins (low ADF) can't keep up
- Trend Following captures the momentum
- Mean Reversion fights the trend and loses

---

### 2. Moderate Up Markets (0-10% BTC 5d change)

**Duration:** 775 days (45.6% of time) - **LARGEST REGIME**  
**Avg BTC 5d Change:** +3.6%

| Strategy | Ann. Return | Sharpe | Max DD | Win Rate |
|----------|-------------|--------|--------|----------|
| **Mean Reversion (EW)** | **+35.9%** | **1.36** | **-27.3%** | **25.2%** |
| Trend Following (RP) | -26.3% | -1.03 | -52.3% | 20.2% |
| Trend Following (EW) | -26.4% | -1.00 | -52.6% | 19.5% |

**Analysis:**
- ✅ **Mean Reversion WINS** in moderate up markets
- ✅ +36% annualized return
- ✅ Positive Sharpe (1.36)
- ✅ Higher win rate (25%)
- ❌ **Trend Following FAILS** badly (-26% annualized)
- ❌ Large drawdowns (-52%)
- ❌ Low win rate (19-20%)

**Why?**
- Moderate moves → choppy, range-bound behavior
- Stationary coins (low ADF) do well in ranges
- Trending coins (high ADF) experience whipsaws
- Mean reversion works; momentum doesn't

---

### 3. Down Markets (0 to -10% BTC 5d change)

**Duration:** 718 days (42.3% of time) - **2nd LARGEST REGIME**  
**Avg BTC 5d Change:** -3.3%

| Strategy | Ann. Return | Sharpe | Max DD | Win Rate |
|----------|-------------|--------|--------|----------|
| **Trend Following (EW)** | **+57.2%** | **2.17** | **-14.5%** | **21.6%** |
| **Trend Following (RP)** | **+47.7%** | **1.91** | **-15.5%** | **22.1%** |
| Mean Reversion (EW) | -36.4% | -1.38 | -67.7% | 21.7% |

**Analysis:**
- ✅ **Trend Following WINS BIG** in down markets
- ✅ +57% annualized return (Equal Weight)
- ✅ Sharpe of 2.17 (excellent)
- ✅ Low drawdown (-14.5%)
- ❌ **Mean Reversion FAILS** (-36% annualized)
- ❌ Massive drawdown (-68%)

**Why?**
- Downtrends → Trending coins (high ADF) fall cleanly
- Stationary coins (low ADF) chop around, hard to short
- Trend Following benefits from shorting stationary coins
- Longing trending coins works even in downtrends (relative strength)

---

### 4. Strong Down Markets (<-10% BTC 5d change)

**Duration:** 87 days (5.1% of time)  
**Avg BTC 5d Change:** -14.4%

| Strategy | Ann. Return | Sharpe | Max DD | Win Rate |
|----------|-------------|--------|--------|----------|
| **Mean Reversion (EW)** | **+34.4%** | **0.66** | **-18.1%** | **19.5%** |
| Trend Following (EW) | -25.6% | -0.49 | -17.1% | 20.7% |
| Trend Following (RP) | -31.8% | -0.62 | -17.0% | 19.5% |

**Analysis:**
- ✅ **Mean Reversion WINS** in crash scenarios
- ✅ +34% annualized return
- ✅ Manageable drawdown (-18%)
- ❌ **Trend Following LOSES** (-26 to -32%)

**Why?**
- Crash scenarios → extreme overshoots
- Stationary coins (low ADF) bounce back quickly (mean reversion)
- Trending coins (high ADF) continue falling (no floor)
- Mean reversion captures the bounce
- Trend following caught on wrong side

## 🔄 Strategy Regime Dependence

### Trend Following (Equal Weight)

```
Best Regime:   Strong Up (>10%)        +87.6% annualized  ⭐⭐⭐
Good Regime:   Down (0 to -10%)        +57.2% annualized  ⭐⭐
Bad Regime:    Up (0-10%)              -26.4% annualized  ❌
Worst Regime:  Strong Down (<-10%)     -25.6% annualized  ❌
```

**Optimal Environment:** Strong directional moves (up or moderate down)

### Mean Reversion (Equal Weight)

```
Best Regime:   Up (0-10%)              +35.9% annualized  ⭐⭐
Good Regime:   Strong Down (<-10%)     +34.4% annualized  ⭐⭐
Bad Regime:    Down (0 to -10%)        -36.4% annualized  ❌
Worst Regime:  Strong Up (>10%)        -46.7% annualized  ❌
```

**Optimal Environment:** Moderate moves (choppy markets) and crash bounces

## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. Strategies Are Regime-Complementary

**NOT "One is better than the other"**

Both strategies work, just in different regimes:

```
Strong Moves (>10%)    → Trend Following wins
Moderate Moves (0-10%) → Mean Reversion wins
```

**Implication:** A regime-switching strategy could combine both!

### 2. Overall Performance Driven by Regime Mix

**Why Trend Following won overall (+20.78% vs -42.93%):**

The period had:
- 12% of time in strong moves (where TF wins massively)
- 42.3% down markets (where TF wins +57%)
- 45.6% moderate up (where MR wins, but not enough to overcome TF's strong performance)

**If regime mix were different:**
- 80% moderate moves → Mean Reversion would win
- 20% strong moves → Trend Following would dominate even more

### 3. Moderate Markets Are Most Common (88% of time)

```
Moderate markets (±10%):  88% of time
Strong markets (>±10%):   12% of time
```

**But:** Strong markets drive outsized returns
- Trend Following: +87% to +113% in strong up
- Mean Reversion: -46% in strong up (destroys overall performance)

**Lesson:** Avoid being on wrong side of strong moves!

### 4. Different Weighting Schemes Excel in Different Regimes

**Risk Parity shines in Strong Up:**
- RP: +113.4% annualized
- EW: +87.6% annualized
- RP advantage: +25.8pp

**Equal Weight better in other regimes:**
- More aggressive allocation
- Captures moves better when directionality is clear

## 🎲 Win Rate Analysis

### Win Rates Are Low Across All Regimes

```
Strategy                Strong Up   Mod Up   Down    Strong Down
─────────────────────   ─────────   ──────   ────    ───────────
Trend Following (EW)       23.7%    19.5%   21.6%      20.7%
Mean Reversion (EW)        15.3%    25.2%   21.7%      19.5%
```

**Observations:**
1. **All win rates < 26%** (most days are losers)
2. Mean Reversion has **lowest win rate in Strong Up** (15.3%)
3. Mean Reversion has **highest win rate in Mod Up** (25.2%)
4. Win rates are similar across most regimes (19-24%)

**Implication:** Success comes from asymmetry (size of wins vs losses), not frequency.

## 🎯 Optimal Strategy by Regime

### If You Could Perfectly Time Regimes

```
Regime                  Optimal Strategy        Ann. Return
──────────────────────  ──────────────────      ───────────
Strong Up (>10%)        Trend Following (RP)    +113.4%
Moderate Up (0-10%)     Mean Reversion (EW)     +35.9%
Down (0 to -10%)        Trend Following (EW)    +57.2%
Strong Down (<-10%)     Mean Reversion (EW)     +34.4%
```

**Weighted Average (Perfect Timing):**
- (6.9% × 113.4%) + (45.6% × 35.9%) + (42.3% × 57.2%) + (5.1% × 34.4%)
- = **+48.6% annualized return**

**vs Actual:**
- Trend Following (always): +4.1% annualized
- Mean Reversion (always): -11.4% annualized

**Improvement from perfect timing:** +44.5pp over Trend Following!

## 🚀 Practical Implications

### 1. Regime-Switching Strategy

**Build a composite strategy:**

```python
if BTC_5d_pct_change > 10:
    use_trend_following()  # +113% expected
elif BTC_5d_pct_change > 0:
    use_mean_reversion()   # +36% expected
elif BTC_5d_pct_change > -10:
    use_trend_following()  # +57% expected
else:  # < -10%
    use_mean_reversion()   # +34% expected
```

**Expected Return:** +48.6% annualized (vs +4.1% for static TF)

**Challenge:** Detecting regime transitions in real-time (5d pct change is backward-looking)

### 2. Dynamic Allocation

**Instead of 100% one strategy, blend based on regime probability:**

```
If volatility is high and moves are large:
    → Allocate 70% Trend Following, 30% Mean Reversion

If volatility is low and moves are moderate:
    → Allocate 30% Trend Following, 70% Mean Reversion
```

### 3. Risk Management by Regime

**Reduce exposure in unfavorable regimes:**

```
Strong Up markets:
    → Trend Following: Full allocation (100%)
    → Mean Reversion: Reduce or exit (0-25%)

Moderate Up markets:
    → Trend Following: Reduce (25-50%)
    → Mean Reversion: Full allocation (100%)
```

### 4. Leading Indicators

**Use leading indicators to predict regime changes:**
- VIX equivalent for crypto
- BTC 30d realized volatility
- Options skew
- Funding rates
- On-chain momentum metrics

## 📊 Drawdown Analysis by Regime

### Maximum Drawdown by Regime

```
Regime              Trend Following (EW)    Mean Reversion (EW)
──────────────────  ────────────────────    ───────────────────
Strong Up               -7.0% ✅                -19.4%
Moderate Up            -52.6% ❌                -27.3% ✅
Down                   -14.5% ✅                -67.7% ❌
Strong Down            -17.1%                  -18.1%
```

**Key Observations:**
1. **Trend Following has tiny drawdowns in strong up** (-7%)
2. **Mean Reversion has massive drawdown in down markets** (-68%)
3. **Both have manageable drawdowns in strong down** (~-18%)
4. **Moderate up is dangerous for Trend Following** (-53%)

**Risk Management Insight:** 
- Trend Following: Protect against moderate chop
- Mean Reversion: Protect against sustained downtrends

## 🔬 Volatility by Regime

### Annualized Volatility by Regime

```
Regime              Trend Following (EW)    Mean Reversion (EW)
──────────────────  ────────────────────    ───────────────────
Strong Up               25.1%                   25.1%
Moderate Up             26.4%                   26.4%
Down                    26.3%                   26.3%
Strong Down             52.5%                   52.5%
```

**Observations:**
1. **Volatility is similar for both strategies** (~25-26%)
2. **Strong down markets double volatility** (52.5%)
3. **Return difference is NOT due to volatility difference**
4. Performance gap is pure directional alpha

## 🎯 Recommendations

### For Live Trading

**1. Implement Regime Detection**

Build a real-time regime classifier:
```python
def detect_regime(btc_prices):
    pct_5d = (btc_prices[-1] / btc_prices[-6] - 1) * 100
    
    if pct_5d > 10:
        return "Strong Up"
    elif pct_5d > 0:
        return "Moderate Up"
    elif pct_5d > -10:
        return "Down"
    else:
        return "Strong Down"
```

**2. Dynamic Strategy Allocation**

```python
regime = detect_regime(btc_prices)

if regime in ["Strong Up", "Down"]:
    allocate_to_trend_following(weight=0.8)
    allocate_to_mean_reversion(weight=0.2)
else:  # Moderate Up or Strong Down
    allocate_to_trend_following(weight=0.2)
    allocate_to_mean_reversion(weight=0.8)
```

**3. Exit Signals**

Add regime-change exits:
```python
if holding_trend_following and regime == "Moderate Up":
    reduce_exposure(50%)  # Bad regime for TF

if holding_mean_reversion and regime == "Strong Up":
    reduce_exposure(50%)  # Bad regime for MR
```

**4. Risk Limits by Regime**

Set dynamic position sizes:
```python
if regime == "Strong Down":
    max_position_size = 0.05  # 5% per position (high vol)
else:
    max_position_size = 0.10  # 10% per position
```

### For Strategy Development

**1. Regime-Conditional Backtests**

Test strategies conditioned on current regime:
```python
# Only trade when in favorable regime
if regime in strategy.favorable_regimes:
    execute_trades()
else:
    hold_cash()  # Or switch to alternative strategy
```

**2. Ensemble Model**

Combine both strategies with regime-based weighting:
```python
portfolio_return = (
    trend_following_return * regime_weight_tf +
    mean_reversion_return * regime_weight_mr
)
```

**3. Leading Indicator Research**

Find indicators that predict regime changes:
- Test if volatility expansion predicts strong moves
- Test if low volatility predicts chop/range
- Test if funding rates predict reversals

**4. Multi-Timeframe Analysis**

Combine signals from different timeframes:
- 5-day regime (tactical)
- 30-day regime (strategic)
- 90-day regime (macro)

## 📈 Theoretical Expected Returns

### If You Could Switch Strategies by Regime

**Optimal Regime-Switching Portfolio:**

```
Regime           % Time    Strategy      Ann. Return   Contribution
─────────────    ──────    ────────────  ───────────   ────────────
Strong Up          6.9%    TF (RP)       +113.4%       +7.8pp
Moderate Up       45.6%    MR (EW)       +35.9%        +16.4pp
Down              42.3%    TF (EW)       +57.2%        +24.2pp
Strong Down        5.1%    MR (EW)       +34.4%        +1.8pp
─────────────    ──────    ────────────  ───────────   ────────────
TOTAL            100.0%                                 +50.2pp
```

**Expected Annualized Return:** +50.2%

**vs Static Strategies:**
- Static Trend Following: +4.1%
- Static Mean Reversion: -11.4%

**Improvement:** +46.1pp from regime-switching!

---

## ⚠️ Caveats & Limitations

### 1. Lookahead Bias in Regime Detection

**Problem:** We classify regimes using 5-day returns, which includes "future" data relative to trade entry.

**Real-world:** You don't know the 5-day return until 5 days have passed.

**Solution:** Use leading indicators (volatility, momentum) to predict regimes, not backward-looking returns.

### 2. Regime Transitions

**Problem:** Strategies struggle during regime transitions.

**Example:** 
- Market switches from "Moderate Up" to "Strong Up" mid-week
- Mean Reversion is already positioned (loses money)
- Trend Following not yet positioned (misses move)

**Solution:** Fast reaction to regime changes, or blend strategies.

### 3. Sample Size

**Strong moves are rare:**
- Strong Up: only 118 days (6.9%)
- Strong Down: only 87 days (5.1%)

Small sample → higher uncertainty in results.

### 4. Parameter Sensitivity

**Results depend on regime thresholds:**
- Used ±10% as threshold
- What if we used ±5%? or ±15%?
- Optimal threshold may vary over time

**Solution:** Test multiple thresholds, use adaptive thresholds.

---

## 🎓 Conclusion

### Major Findings

1. **ADF strategies are REGIME-DEPENDENT, not universally superior**
   - Trend Following: Best in strong moves (±57% to +113%)
   - Mean Reversion: Best in moderate moves (+35%) and crashes (+34%)

2. **Overall winner determined by regime distribution**
   - 2021-2025 favored Trend Following (lots of strong moves)
   - Different period could favor Mean Reversion (choppy markets)

3. **Regime-switching could dramatically improve performance**
   - Perfect timing: +50% annualized
   - Static best: +4% annualized
   - Improvement: +46pp

4. **Both strategies have value**
   - Don't abandon Mean Reversion (works in 50% of regimes)
   - Don't assume Trend Following always wins (fails in moderate up)

### Practical Takeaway

**Build a regime-aware system:**

```
1. Detect current market regime (volatility, momentum, etc.)
2. Allocate to strategy that excels in that regime
3. Adjust position sizes based on regime risk
4. Exit or reduce when regime becomes unfavorable
5. Rebalance when regime changes
```

**Expected improvement:** +10-20pp over static strategy
