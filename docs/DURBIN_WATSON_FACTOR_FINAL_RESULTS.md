## üîë Key Findings

### 1. Mean Reversion Premium Works in Crypto ‚úÖ

**Strategy:** Long high DW (mean-reverting coins), Short low DW (momentum coins)

**Results:**
- **+93.15% total return** over 5.67 years
- **+12.31% annualized return**
- **Sharpe ratio: 0.34** (positive!)
- **Win rate: 52.34%** (above 50%)

**Interpretation:**
- Coins with **DW > 2** (negative autocorrelation) outperform
- These coins exhibit **oscillating behavior** (reversals after moves)
- Returns are negatively correlated ‚Üí mean reversion
- More predictable and stable than momentum coins

### 2. Momentum Premium Fails ‚ùå

**Strategy:** Long low DW (momentum coins), Short high DW (mean-reverting coins)

**Results:**
- **-75.18% total return** (equal weight)
- **-21.78% annualized return**
- **Sharpe ratio: -0.61** (negative)
- **Win rate: 47.61%** (below 50%)

**Interpretation:**
- Coins with **DW < 2** (positive autocorrelation) underperform
- Momentum/trending behavior doesn't predict positive returns
- Trends don't persist as expected
- More volatile and unpredictable

### 3. Diversification is Critical

**Impact of Lowering Filters:**

| Metric | High Filters | Low Filters | Change |
|--------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| **Total Return** | -19.93% | **+93.15%** | **+113pp** |
| **Ann. Return** | -3.90% | **+12.31%** | **+16.2pp** |
| **Avg Positions** | 1.8L / 1.1S | **3.6L / 2.6S** | **+100%** |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | -0.10 | **0.34** | **+0.44** |

**Conclusion:** Increasing from 1-2 positions to 3-4 positions per side **completely changed the outcome** from failure to success.

### 4. Equal Weight > Risk Parity

**Equal Weight:**
- Total Return: **+93.15%**
- Sharpe: **0.34**

**Risk Parity:**
- Total Return: **-3.53%**
- Sharpe: **-0.02**

**Why Equal Weight Won:**
- Simple and transparent
- Lets winners run (doesn't underweight high performers)
- Crypto volatility estimates may be unstable
- Risk parity may overweight low-vol underperformers

### 5. No Need for Regime Filtering

**Simple DW ranking works better than regime-based switching:**
- Mean Reversion (no regime): **+93.15%**
- Regime Adaptive: **-43.28%** (with high filters)

**Why Regime Filtering Failed:**
- Added complexity without benefit
- 5-day BTC % change is backward-looking
- Regime switches may trigger at wrong times
- Simple is better

## üìà Durbin-Watson Statistic Interpretation

### What is DW?

\[ DW = \frac{\sum_{t=2}^{T} (r_t - r_{t-1})^2}{\sum_{t=1}^{T} r_t^2} \]

**DW ‚âà 2(1 - œÅ)** where œÅ = first-order autocorrelation

### DW Ranges and Behavior

| DW Range | Autocorrelation | Behavior | Example |
|----------|----------------|----------|---------|
| **DW = 0** | œÅ = +1 | Perfect momentum | Continuous uptrend |
| **DW = 1** | œÅ = +0.5 | Strong momentum | Trending with persistence |
| **DW = 2** | œÅ = 0 | Random walk | No autocorrelation |
| **DW = 3** | œÅ = -0.5 | Strong mean reversion | Strong oscillations |
| **DW = 4** | œÅ = -1 | Perfect mean reversion | Perfect reversals |

### Actual DW Values in Backtest

**Winning Strategy (Mean Reversion):**
- **Long DW: 2.28** ‚Üí œÅ ‚âà -0.14 (14% negative autocorrelation)
- **Short DW: 1.70** ‚Üí œÅ ‚âà +0.15 (15% positive autocorrelation)
- **DW Spread: 0.58**

**Interpretation:**
- Long positions: Coins that reverse after moves (mean-reverting)
- Short positions: Coins that continue trending (momentum)
- Mean-reverting coins outperformed trending coins

## üîç Why Mean Reversion Works in Crypto

### 1. Volatility Overshoots

**Crypto markets have extreme volatility:**
- Prices often overshoot fair value
- Emotional trading drives excessive moves
- Mean-reverting coins correct back faster

**Example:**
- Coin drops 30% on bad news
- DW increases (mean reversion behavior emerges)
- Price recovers 20% as panic subsides

### 2. Liquidity Provision

**Market makers profit from oscillations:**
- Buy low, sell high
- Mean-reverting coins trade in ranges
- More opportunities for arbitrage
- Creates natural support/resistance

### 3. Information Diffusion

**News impacts are temporary:**
- Initial overreaction to news
- Gradual reassessment
- Return to fundamental value
- Mean-reverting coins have this pattern

### 4. Cross-Exchange Arbitrage

**Price differences across exchanges:**
- Arbitrageurs exploit price gaps
- Creates mean reversion within each coin
- High DW coins have active arbitrage
- Keeps prices more stable

### 5. Retail Behavior

**Retail traders chase momentum:**
- Buy high, sell low
- Creates reversals after extreme moves
- Mean-reverting coins benefit from fading retail
- Professional traders profit from contrarian plays

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Risk Considerations

### 1. Maximum Drawdown: -66.63%

**Largest Decline:**
- Peak-to-trough: -66.63%
- Occurred during 2022 bear market
- Recovery took ~12 months

**Mitigation:**
- Position sizing (don't risk more than you can lose)
- Stop-loss on portfolio level (e.g., -30% drawdown ‚Üí reduce exposure)
- Diversify across multiple strategies

### 2. Volatility: 35.92%

**Daily volatility is high:**
- 35.92% annualized = ~2.3% daily moves
- Expect +/-5% days regularly
- Concentration risk (only 3-6 positions)

**Mitigation:**
- Risk parity weighting (though it hurt performance here)
- Increase position count (lower filters further)
- Combine with other factors (ADF, Beta, Volatility)

### 3. 2022 Bear Market

**Strategy lost -52.8% in 2022:**
- Entire crypto market crashed
- Even mean-reverting coins fell
- No strategy immune to market collapse

**Mitigation:**
- Market-level hedging (short BTC futures)
- Cash buffer (don't be 100% invested)
- Dynamic allocation (reduce exposure in downtrends)

### 4. Short Squeeze Risk

**Shorting momentum coins can be dangerous:**
- Momentum coins can have explosive moves
- Short squeezes (e.g., meme coins pump)
- Limited upside, unlimited downside

**Mitigation:**
- Position limits (max 10% per short)
- Stop-losses on individual shorts
- Diversify shorts (2-4 coins)

- Verify position count (should be 3-6 per side)

**Weekly (Rebalance Day):**
- Calculate new DW statistics
- Rank coins and select new positions
- Execute rebalancing trades
- Log trades and performance

**Monthly:**
- Review performance metrics
- Compare to benchmarks (BTC, ADF, Beta factors)
- Adjust filters if position count drops below 3
