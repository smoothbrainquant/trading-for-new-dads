# OI Data Loading Improvements Summary

## Date: 2025-10-27

## Overview
Enhanced OI (Open Interest) data loading in `main.py` with robust error handling and date validation to prevent date mismatch issues.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced OI Data Loading (`execution/strategies/open_interest_divergence.py`)

#### Improvements to `_load_aggregated_oi_from_file()`:

- **Column Validation**: Added validation for required columns (`coin_symbol`, `date`, `oi_close`)
- **Date Parsing**: Added error handling for date parsing with `pd.to_datetime(errors='coerce')`
- **Data Freshness Checks**:
  - Warns if data is more than 7 days old
  - Detects and warns about future dates (data quality issues)
- **Graceful Degradation**: Returns all available data if filter produces empty dataframe
- **Base Symbol Extraction**: Added try-except for robust symbol extraction
- **Data Quality Validation**: Checks for null OI values
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed status messages for troubleshooting

#### Improvements to `strategy_oi_divergence()`:

- **Date Overlap Validation**: Checks for date overlap between OI and price data before computing scores
- **Fallback Handling**: Uses most recent available date if latest date has no scores
- **Clear Error Messages**: Informative warnings when data issues occur

### 2. Enhanced Merge Validation (`signals/calc_open_interest_divergence.py`)

#### Improvements to `compute_oi_divergence_scores()`:

- **Pre-merge Validation**: Checks for empty dataframes before merge
- **Date Overlap Check**: Validates date ranges overlap before merge
- **Symbol Overlap Check**: Validates symbol overlap before merge
- **Diagnostic Output**: Shows overlap statistics when merge fails

## Diagnostic Tool

Created `check_oi_data_dates.py` to diagnose OI data loading issues:

- Checks OI data file availability and format
- Validates date ranges in OI data
- Fetches sample price data and validates dates
- Checks date overlap between OI and price data
- Checks symbol overlap
- Tests actual strategy loading function
- Provides comprehensive diagnostic summary

## Key Features

### 1. Date Mismatch Detection
- Automatically detects when OI and price data date ranges don't overlap
- Provides clear diagnostic messages about the gap
- Returns empty results gracefully instead of crashing

### 2. Data Staleness Warnings
- Warns if OI data is more than 7 days old
- Suggests refreshing data for accurate signals
- Detects future dates (potential data quality issues)

### 3. Robust Error Handling
- Gracefully handles missing files
- Handles invalid dates with `errors='coerce'`
- Validates column presence before processing
- Catches and logs all exceptions with traceback

### 4. Comprehensive Logging
All operations now provide detailed status messages:
- ✓ Success indicators (green check)
- ⚠️ Warning indicators (yellow warning)
- ❌ Error indicators (red X)

## Testing Results

Ran diagnostic script with successful results:
```
✓ All checks passed!
  - OI data loaded: 221,330 rows for 384 symbols
  - Date range: 2021-04-09 to 2025-10-26 (1,661 days)
  - Data freshness: 1 day old (within acceptable range)
  - Date overlap: 200 days (2025-04-10 to 2025-10-26)
  - Symbol overlap: All test symbols found
```

## Usage

### Running Diagnostics
```bash
python3 check_oi_data_dates.py
```

### Expected OI Data File Format
- Location: `/workspace/data/raw/`
- Pattern: `historical_open_interest_all_perps_since2020_*.csv`
- Required columns: `coin_symbol`, `date`, `oi_close`

## Error Messages Guide

### "No aggregated OI data file found"
**Cause**: Missing OI data file  
**Solution**: Run OI data collection script to download aggregated data

### "OI data is X days old"
**Cause**: OI data hasn't been refreshed recently  
**Solution**: Refresh OI data for more accurate signals

### "No date overlap between OI and price data"
**Cause**: Date ranges don't overlap (data collection issue)  
**Solution**: Check data collection scripts; ensure both data sources cover same time period

### "No symbol overlap for OI divergence merge"
**Cause**: Symbol naming mismatch between OI and price data  
**Solution**: Verify symbol mapping and `get_base_symbol()` function

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Silent Failures**: Detects issues early with clear warnings
2. **Easier Debugging**: Comprehensive logging helps identify root causes
3. **Data Quality Monitoring**: Automatic checks for stale or invalid data
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Returns empty results instead of crashing
5. **Production Ready**: Robust error handling for automated execution

## Files Modified

1. `execution/strategies/open_interest_divergence.py` - Enhanced OI loading and validation
2. `signals/calc_open_interest_divergence.py` - Enhanced merge validation
3. `check_oi_data_dates.py` - New diagnostic tool (can be deleted after testing)

## Next Steps

1. Run `check_oi_data_dates.py` periodically to verify data quality
2. Set up alerts for stale OI data (>7 days old)
3. Consider automating OI data refresh as part of daily workflow
4. Monitor logs for warnings during production runs

## Compatibility

All changes are backward compatible and don't affect existing functionality. The improvements only add validation and better error messages.
