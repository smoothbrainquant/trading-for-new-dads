# Skew Factor Trading Strategy Specification

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-10-27  
**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This specification outlines a simple long/short factor strategy based on return skewness. The core hypothesis is that cryptocurrencies exhibit predictable patterns based on their recent return distribution asymmetry, where skewness can signal future reversals or continuations.

### Key Objectives
1. Calculate 30-day rolling skewness for all cryptocurrencies
2. Rank coins by skewness metric
3. Implement long/short portfolio based on skewness rankings
4. Backtest performance with proper no-lookahead methodology
5. Compare to buy-and-hold and other existing strategies

---

## 2. Strategy Overview

### 2.1 Core Concept

**Skewness** measures the asymmetry of return distribution:
- **Negative skewness:** More extreme losses than gains (left tail)
- **Positive skewness:** More extreme gains than losses (right tail)

**Trading Hypothesis:**
Skewness patterns may predict future returns through mean reversion or momentum effects.

### 2.2 Signal Rules

#### Long/Short Formation
1. **Calculate Skewness:** 30-day rolling skewness of daily returns for each coin
2. **Rank Coins:** Sort all coins by skewness (low to high)
3. **Portfolio Construction:**
   - **Long:** Bottom quintile (20% with lowest/most negative skewness)
   - **Short:** Top quintile (20% with highest/most positive skewness)
4. **Rebalance:** Daily

#### Position Sizing
- **Equal Weight:** Each position gets equal notional weight within long and short portfolios
- **Dollar Neutral:** Long notional = Short notional (zero net exposure)

## 3. Data Requirements

### 3.1 Input Data

**Source:** `data/raw/combined_coinbase_coinmarketcap_daily.csv`

**Required Fields:**
- `date`: Trading date
- `symbol`: Cryptocurrency ticker
- `close`: Daily close price
- `volume`: Daily trading volume
- `market_cap`: Market capitalization

**Coverage:**
- 172 cryptocurrencies
- 2020-01-01 to present
- Daily frequency

### 3.2 Filters

**Liquidity Filter:**
- Minimum 30-day average volume > $5M USD
- Ensures tradeable liquidity

**Data Quality Filter:**
- Require at least 30 consecutive days of data for skewness calculation
- Exclude coins with missing data in the calculation window

**Market Cap Filter:**
- Minimum market cap > $50M USD
- Filters out micro-cap illiquid coins

---

## 4. Signal Calculation

### 4.1 Return Calculation

```python
# Daily log returns
returns_t = log(close_t / close_t-1)
```

### 4.2 Skewness Calculation

```python
# 30-day rolling skewness
skewness_t = skew(returns[t-29:t])  # Uses past 30 days of returns

# Python implementation
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import skew

df['returns'] = np.log(df['close'] / df['close'].shift(1))
df['skewness_30d'] = df.groupby('symbol')['returns'].rolling(30).apply(
    lambda x: skew(x), raw=True
).reset_index(level=0, drop=True)
```

### 4.3 Ranking and Signal Generation

```python
# For each date t
for each date t:
    # 1. Filter valid coins (liquidity, market cap, data quality)
    valid_coins = apply_filters(data, date=t)
    
    # 2. Rank by skewness
    ranked = valid_coins.sort_values('skewness_30d')
    
    # 3. Determine quintiles
    n_coins = len(ranked)
    quintile_size = n_coins // 5
    
    # 4. Generate signals
    long_signals = ranked.iloc[:quintile_size]['symbol']  # Bottom 20%
    short_signals = ranked.iloc[-quintile_size:]['symbol']  # Top 20%
    
    # 5. Calculate equal weights
    long_weight = 1.0 / len(long_signals)
    short_weight = -1.0 / len(short_signals)
```

---

## 5. Backtesting Methodology

### 5.1 No-Lookahead Bias Prevention

**CRITICAL:** Signals generated on day `t` must use returns from day `t+1`

```python
# Calculate signals using data up to and including day t
signals_t = calculate_signals(data[data.date <= t])

# Apply returns from day t+1 for P&L
returns_t1 = data[data.date == t + 1]['returns']
pnl_t1 = signals_t * returns_t1.shift(-1)  # Use next-day returns
```

### 5.2 Backtest Implementation

**File:** `backtests/scripts/backtest_skew_factor.py`

**Procedure:**
1. **Load Data:** Read combined price data
2. **Calculate Returns:** Compute daily log returns
3. **Rolling Window:**
   - For each date `t` from start_date to end_date:
     - Filter valid coins (liquidity, market cap, data quality)
     - Calculate 30-day skewness for each coin using data up to day `t`
     - Rank coins by skewness
     - Generate long/short signals (bottom/top quintiles)
     - Calculate equal weights for long and short portfolios
     - Apply day `t+1` returns to positions
     - Record P&L, positions, turnover
4. **Calculate Performance Metrics**
5. **Generate Visualizations**

### 5.3 Portfolio Construction

**Long Portfolio:**
- Weight: +100% of capital
- Positions: Bottom 20% by skewness (most negative)
- Equal weight per position

**Short Portfolio:**
- Weight: -100% of capital (short)
- Positions: Top 20% by skewness (most positive)
- Equal weight per position

**Net Exposure:**
- Dollar neutral: Long notional = Short notional
- Net beta â‰ˆ 0 (market neutral)

### 5.4 Rebalancing

**Frequency:** Daily
- Recalculate skewness each day
- Re-rank all coins
- Update long/short portfolios

**Turnover:** Track daily turnover
```python
turnover_t = sum(abs(weight_t - weight_t-1)) / 2
```

## 10. Expected Insights

### 10.1 Hypotheses

**Hypothesis 1: Mean Reversion**
- Coins with extreme negative skewness (crash risk) may rebound
- Coins with extreme positive skewness (momentum) may correct
- **Test:** Negative skewness â†’ positive future returns

**Hypothesis 2: Risk Premium**
- Negative skewness = crash risk = compensation required
- Investors demand premium for holding negative skew assets
- **Test:** Negative skewness â†’ positive risk premium

**Hypothesis 3: Momentum/Continuation**
- Positive skewness = upside momentum = continues
- Negative skewness = downside momentum = continues
- **Test:** Positive skewness â†’ positive future returns (opposite of H1)

### 10.2 Success Criteria

**Minimum Performance Targets:**
- Sharpe Ratio > 0.5 (annualized)
- Max Drawdown < 40%
- Positive returns vs buy-and-hold BTC
- Low correlation to BTC (< 0.5)
- Turnover < 50% daily

## 11. Risk Considerations

### 11.1 Strategy Risks

**Market Risk:**
- Dollar-neutral but not market-neutral (crypto beta exposure)
- Extreme market moves can cause both long and short to lose

**Correlation Risk:**
- Assumes stable correlation structure
- Correlations spike to 1 during crashes

**Liquidity Risk:**
- Small coins may have thin markets
- Slippage on rebalancing

**Short Squeeze Risk:**
- Shorting crypto can be expensive (funding rates)
- Short positions vulnerable to squeezes

### 11.2 Implementation Risks

**Transaction Costs:**
- Daily rebalancing = high turnover
- Fees of 0.05-0.1% can erode returns
- Slippage on market orders

**Data Quality:**
- Missing data can cause incorrect rankings
- Outliers can skew skewness calculation

**Execution:**
- Assumes perfect execution at close prices
- Real-world execution may differ

### 11.3 Backtest Risks

**Overfitting:**
- Single parameter (30d lookback) reduces overfitting risk
- Still need out-of-sample validation

**Survivorship Bias:**
- Dataset may not include delisted coins
- May overstate historical returns

**Regime Shift:**
- Past patterns may not continue
- Crypto market evolving rapidly
