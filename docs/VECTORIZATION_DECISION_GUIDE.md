## ✅ Category 1: Fully Vectorizable (Easy Wins)

### Pattern: Simple Ranking-Based Factors

**Characteristics:**
- Rank assets by a single metric (volatility, beta, market cap, etc.)
- Select top N or bottom N, or by quintiles/percentiles
- Equal weight or risk parity within groups
- No dependencies between time periods

### Examples

#### 1. **Volatility Factor** ✅
```python
# Current: Loop through each date (SLOW)
for date in dates:
    ranked = rank_by_volatility(data, date)  # One date at a time
    long = ranked[ranked['quintile'] == 1]
    short = ranked[ranked['quintile'] == 5]

# Vectorized: Process all dates at once (FAST)
data['quintile'] = data.groupby('date')['volatility'].transform(
    lambda x: pd.qcut(x, q=5, labels=range(1, 6))
)
data['signal'] = 0
data.loc[data['quintile'] == 1, 'signal'] = 1
data.loc[data['quintile'] == 5, 'signal'] = -1
```

**Why it works:**
- Each date is independent
- Simple ranking operation
- No sequential dependencies

**Expected speedup:** 30-50x

#### 2. **Beta Factor** ✅
Same pattern as volatility - just rank by beta instead.

#### 3. **Carry Factor (Funding Rates)** ✅
```python
# Vectorized: Top N / Bottom N selection
data['rank'] = data.groupby('date')['funding_rate'].rank(method='first')
data['count'] = data.groupby('date')['funding_rate'].transform('count')
data['signal'] = 0
data.loc[data['rank'] <= 10, 'signal'] = 1  # Long bottom 10
data.loc[data['rank'] > (data['count'] - 10), 'signal'] = -1  # Short top 10
```

**Why it works:**
- Simple ranking on single metric
- No cross-period dependencies

**Expected speedup:** 30-50x

#### 4. **Size Factor (Market Cap)** ✅
Same pattern - rank by market cap, select quintiles.

#### 5. **Skew Factor** ✅
```python
# Already partially vectorized in your code!
# From backtest_skew_factor.py line 142:
df_with_signals = df.groupby("date", group_keys=False).apply(rank_by_skewness)
```

**Current state:** Uses `groupby().apply()` which is better than loops but can be improved.

**Full vectorization:**
```python
# Remove the apply() and use pure vectorized operations
df['quintile'] = df.groupby('date')['skewness_30d'].transform(
    lambda x: pd.qcut(x.rank(method='first'), q=5, labels=range(1, 6))
)
```

**Expected speedup:** 15-30x (already semi-vectorized)

#### 6. **Kurtosis Factor** ✅
Identical to skew - rank by kurtosis, select by percentiles.

#### 7. **ADF Factor (Mean Reversion)** ✅
Rank by ADF statistic, same pattern as volatility/beta.

### Migration Priority: **HIGH** ⭐⭐⭐
**Time investment:** 2-3 hours per factor
**Return:** 30-50x speedup per factor

## ⚠️ Category 2: Partially Vectorizable (Medium Wins)

### Pattern: Multi-Step Calculations with Some Sequential Logic

**Characteristics:**
- Require rolling calculations (can be vectorized with `.transform()`)
- Multi-factor scoring (can be vectorized)
- Some filtering logic (can be vectorized with boolean masks)
- BUT: May have complex feature engineering steps

### Examples

#### 1. **OI Divergence** ⚠️

**Current approach:**
```python
# From backtest_open_interest_divergence.py
scores = compute_oi_divergence_scores(oi_df, price_df, lookback=30)

for dt in tracking_dates:
    df_day = scores[scores["date"] == dt]
    # Select top/bottom by score
    longs = sel.head(cfg.top_n)["symbol"].tolist()
    shorts = sel.tail(cfg.bottom_n)["symbol"].tolist()
```

**What CAN be vectorized:**
- ✅ Score calculation (rolling z-scores)
- ✅ Ranking by score
- ✅ Signal generation

**What's ALREADY vectorized:**
- ✅ `compute_oi_divergence_scores()` computes for all dates at once
- ✅ Rolling calculations use `.transform()`

**What CANNOT be easily vectorized:**
- ❌ Complex OI/price alignment logic
- ❌ Missing data handling across multiple sources

**Current state:** Already ~70% vectorized!

**Additional gains:** 10-20x on the selection logic

**Migration Priority:** MEDIUM ⭐⭐ (diminishing returns)

#### 2. **Basket Divergence** ⚠️

**Current approach:**
```python
# From calc_basket_divergence_signals.py
# Compares individual coins to basket (market cap weighted average)
```

**What CAN be vectorized:**
- ✅ Basket calculation (weighted average)
- ✅ Z-score calculation per date
- ✅ Signal generation

**What's challenging:**
- ⚠️ Market cap weighting changes over time
- ⚠️ Coin universe changes (some coins enter/exit)

**Expected speedup:** 5-15x

**Migration Priority:** MEDIUM ⭐⭐

---

## ⚠️ Category 3: Minimally Vectorizable (Small Wins)

### Pattern: Sequential Dependencies or Complex State

**Characteristics:**
- Each step depends on previous results
- Stateful calculations (e.g., tracking trendlines)
- Complex pattern detection
- BUT: Individual components can still be vectorized

### Examples

#### 1. **Trendline Breakout** ⚠️

**Current approach:**
```python
# From backtest_trendline_breakout.py
def detect_breakout_signals(data, breakout_threshold=1.5, min_r2=0.5):
    """
    Detect breakouts based on:
    - Trendline regression (calculated over rolling window)
    - R² quality metric
    - Z-score of distance from trendline
    - Slope direction
    """
```

**What CAN be vectorized:**
- ✅ Rolling window operations (`.rolling()`)
- ✅ Z-score calculations
- ✅ Boolean mask filtering (R² > threshold, etc.)
- ✅ Signal assignment

**What's ALREADY vectorized:**
```python
# Line 223-256 already uses vectorized operations!
df['signal'] = 0
bullish_mask = (
    clean_mask &
    (df['norm_slope'] > 0) &
    (df['breakout_z_score'] > breakout_threshold) &
    (df['distance_from_trendline'] > 0)
)
df.loc[bullish_mask, 'signal'] = 1
```

**What CANNOT be easily vectorized:**
- ❌ Trendline regression itself (requires `scipy.stats.linregress` per window)
- BUT: Can be parallelized with `.apply()` + `joblib` or `multiprocessing`

**Current state:** Already ~80% vectorized!

**Additional gains:** 5-10x (mostly in trendline calculation)

**Migration Priority:** LOW ⭐ (already efficient)

#### 2. **Reversal Signals** ⚠️

Similar to trendline breakout - mostly vectorized already.

---

## ❌ Category 4: Cannot Be Vectorized

### Pattern: Truly Sequential or External Dependencies

**Characteristics:**
- Requires API calls or external data
- Complex state machines
- Human-in-the-loop decisions
- Order-dependent calculations

### Examples

#### 1. **Live Market Data Fetching** ❌
```python
# Cannot vectorize - each call depends on external API
for symbol in symbols:
    data = api.fetch_ohlcv(symbol)
```

**Why not:** External API calls are inherently sequential (or limited by API rate limits).

**Solution:** Use async/await or threading, not vectorization.

#### 2. **Portfolio Rebalancing with Transaction Costs** ❌
```python
# Cannot fully vectorize - current positions affect next rebalance
for date in dates:
    old_positions = current_positions
    new_positions = calculate_target_positions()
    trades = new_positions - old_positions
    costs = calculate_transaction_costs(trades)
    current_positions = execute_trades(trades)
```

**Why not:** Current positions are state that changes with each iteration.

**Partial solution:** Can vectorize the weight calculations, but execution logic remains sequential.

#### 3. **Event-Driven Strategies** ❌
```python
# Cannot vectorize - depends on specific event sequences
if earnings_announcement and price_drops_5_percent:
    enter_position()
elif position_held_for_30_days:
    exit_position()
```

**Why not:** Complex conditional logic based on past events.

## Code Reusability

Once you vectorize one ranking factor, the others follow the same pattern!

**Template for all ranking factors:**
```python
def generate_<FACTOR>_signals_vectorized(
    data,
    strategy='long_low_short_high',
    num_quintiles=5
):
    # Step 1: Assign quintiles (vectorized)
    data['quintile'] = data.groupby('date')['<METRIC>'].transform(
        lambda x: pd.qcut(x, q=num_quintiles, labels=range(1, num_quintiles+1))
    )
    
    # Step 2: Generate signals (vectorized)
    data['signal'] = 0
    data.loc[data['quintile'] == 1, 'signal'] = 1  # Long
    data.loc[data['quintile'] == num_quintiles, 'signal'] = -1  # Short
    
    return data
```

This same code works for:
- Volatility (metric = volatility_30d)
- Beta (metric = beta)
- Carry (metric = funding_rate)
- Size (metric = market_cap)
- Skew (metric = skewness_30d)
- Kurtosis (metric = kurtosis_30d)
- ADF (metric = adf_stat)
- Trendline (metric = norm_slope)

**8 factors with 1 pattern = massive code reuse!**

## Conclusion

**✅ VECTORIZE (11 signals):**
- Volatility, Beta, Carry, Size, Skew, Kurtosis, ADF, Trendline, Mean Reversion
- **Expected total speedup: 30-50x per signal**
- **Time investment: 2-3 hours per signal**

**⚠️ PARTIAL (3 signals):**
- OI Divergence, Basket Divergence, Trendline Breakout
- **Expected speedup: 5-20x**
- **Already partially optimized**

**❌ DON'T VECTORIZE:**
- Live data fetching → use async
- Complex stateful logic → keep as-is or use other optimizations

**Bottom line:** ~70% of your signals are perfect vectorization candidates with massive speedup potential!
