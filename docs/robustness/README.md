## 🗺️ Implementation Roadmap

### Week 1: Validation & Retry
Add validation to critical paths, retry logic to APIs

### Week 2: Logging & Monitoring
Structured logging, basic metrics

### Week 3: Testing & CI/CD
Expand tests to 50%, setup GitHub Actions

### Week 4: Quality & Docs
Format code, add type hints, create runbooks

See `IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed daily tasks.

## 💡 Quick Reference

### Add Validation to a File
See templates in `QUICK_COMMANDS.md`:
- Template 1: Backtest scripts
- Template 2: Signal generation
- Template 3: Execution scripts
- Template 4: API retry logic

### Run Quality Checks
```bash
black .                    # Format
ruff check . --fix        # Lint
isort .                   # Sort imports
python3 run_tests.py      # Test
```

### Check Progress
```bash
# Coverage
python3 -m pytest tests/ --cov=signals --cov=backtests --cov=execution --cov=common --cov-report=term

# Tests count
grep -r "def test_" tests/ | wc -l
```

## 📈 Success Metrics

Track these as you implement:

- **Test Coverage**: 10% → 80%+
- **Files with Validation**: 0 → 10+
- **Type Coverage**: 0% → 100% (public APIs)
- **CI/CD**: None → GitHub Actions
- **Documentation**: Minimal → Comprehensive
