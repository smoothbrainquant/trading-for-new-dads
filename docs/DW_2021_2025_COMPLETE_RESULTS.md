## üîç Deep Analysis

### Why Risk Parity Failed Overall

**2023 (Test Period) vs 2024 (Reality)**

| Metric | 2023 (Test) | 2024 (Real) | Delta |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Return | +52.89% | -50.41% | **-103.30%** |
| Sharpe | 2.25 | -0.87 | **-3.12** |
| Max DD | -8.32% | -54.24% | **-45.92%** |

**What Happened:**
1. **2023 was unusually stable** - Low volatility (16.23%), small drawdowns (-8.32%)
2. **60d DW window + 14d rebalance** worked perfectly in stable market
3. **2024 was volatile** - High volatility (39.71%), large drawdowns (-54.24%)
4. **Longer parameters = slower adaptation** - Couldn't adjust to regime change
5. **Risk parity amplified losses** - Lower vol coins got higher weight, then crashed

### Why Contrarian Wins

**Key Success Factors:**

1. **Shorter DW Window (30d):**
   - Faster adaptation to market changes
   - More responsive to regime shifts

2. **Weekly Rebalancing (7d):**
   - More frequent position adjustments
   - Better risk management

3. **Equal Weight:**
   - Simple, no optimization
   - More diversified (2.2L + 1.3S avg positions)
   - No concentration risk

4. **Consistent Logic:**
   - Long High DW (mean reverting) = stable coins
   - Short Low DW (momentum) = volatile coins
   - Works across different market conditions

### Market Regime Dependency

**Contrarian Performance by Market Condition:**

| Condition | Year | Return | Interpretation |
|-----------|------|--------|----------------|
| Bull | 2021 | +29% | ‚úÖ Good |
| Bear | 2022 | +36% | ‚úÖ Excellent (market neutral worked!) |
| Recovery | 2023 | +22% | ‚úÖ Good |
| Bull | 2024 | +54% | ‚úÖ Great |
| Mixed | 2025 | -11% | ‚ö†Ô∏è Down YTD |

**Key Insight:** Contrarian works in BOTH bull and bear markets because it's market neutral.

## üí° Critical Lessons Learned

### 1. **Test Across Multiple Years**

‚ùå **Wrong:** Testing on 2023 data alone ‚Üí Risk Parity Sharpe 2.75!  
‚úÖ **Right:** Testing on 2021-2025 ‚Üí Risk Parity Sharpe -0.25 (NEGATIVE!)

**Takeaway:** Single-year optimization = overfitting. Must test full market cycle.

### 2. **Simpler is More Robust**

| Parameter | Contrarian (Winner) | Risk Parity (Loser) |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| DW Window | 30d (shorter) | 60d (longer) |
| Rebalance | 7d (frequent) | 14d (less frequent) |
| Weighting | Equal (simple) | Risk Parity (complex) |
| Result | +197% | -42% |

**Takeaway:** Complexity doesn't help. Simple = robust.

### 3. **Parameter Stability Matters**

- **30d DW:** Sharpe 0.53 across all years (stable)
- **60d DW:** Sharpe 2.25 in 2023, -0.87 in 2024 (unstable)

**Takeaway:** Best parameters in one period can be worst in another.

### 4. **Momentum Continuation is Toxic**

- Lost money in 4 out of 5 years
- Total loss: -83.85%
- Confirms: Low DW (momentum) should be SHORTED, not longed

**Takeaway:** Contrarian approach is correct for crypto DW factor.

## üéØ Strategy Recommendations

### For Live Trading: Use Contrarian (30d)

**Configuration:**
- **DW Window:** 30 days
- **Rebalance:** Every 7 days
- **Weighting:** Equal weight
- **Universe:** Top 100 by market cap
- **Allocation:** 50% long, 50% short

**Expected Performance:**
- **Return:** 15-20% annualized
- **Sharpe:** 0.5-0.7
- **Max DD:** 30-40%
- **Win Rate:** 45%

**Pros:**
- ‚úÖ Consistent across market cycles

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires discipline during drawdowns

### Risk Management

**Position Sizing:**
- Max 5% per position
- Cap total long/short at 50% each
- Monitor daily for concentration

**Stop Loss (Optional):**
- Portfolio level: -20% from peak ‚Üí reduce exposure to 25%
- Individual position: None (hold until rebalance)

**Rebalancing Discipline:**
- Stick to 7-day schedule
- Don't skip rebalances in volatile markets
- Execute at close prices

## üî¨ Why Does This Work?

### The DW Factor Logic

**High DW (Mean Reverting) Coins:**
- Choppy, oscillating price action
- **Behavior:** Tend to stay range-bound
- **Why go LONG:** Stable, defensive, less volatile
- **Examples:** Mature coins, stablecoins, blue chips

**Low DW (Momentum) Coins:**
- Trending, persistent moves
- **Behavior:** Strong moves that eventually exhaust
- **Why go SHORT:** Overextended trends revert
- **Examples:** Hype coins, meme tokens, new launches

**Market Neutral Construction:**
- Long stable + Short volatile = balanced
- Zero net market exposure
- Captures alpha from autocorrelation patterns

### Why 2023 Was Different

**2023 Market Characteristics:**
- Low overall volatility
- Stable uptrend
- Mean reversion patterns very strong
- Risk parity worked because vol was low and predictable

**2024 Market Characteristics:**
- High volatility
- Multiple regime shifts
- Momentum exhaustion less predictable
- Risk parity failed because low-vol coins crashed harder

**Lesson:** Static parameters can't handle regime changes.

## üìä Comparison to Other Strategies

### vs Buy & Hold BTC (2021-2025)

| Strategy | Return | Volatility | Sharpe | Max DD |
|----------|--------|------------|--------|--------|
| BTC Buy & Hold | ~150%* | ~70%* | ~0.3* | ~-75%* |
| DW Contrarian | +197% | 33% | 0.53 | -37% |

*Approximate based on BTC price movement

**Key Advantages of DW Contrarian:**
- ‚úÖ Higher Sharpe (better risk-adjusted)
- ‚úÖ Much lower volatility (33% vs 70%)
- ‚úÖ Much lower max drawdown (-37% vs -75%)
- ‚úÖ Market neutral (works in bear markets)

### vs Other Factor Strategies

*To be compared with Beta, Volatility, Skew, Kurtosis factors*

**Expected Ranking:**
1. Volatility Factor (highest Sharpe)
2. **DW Contrarian** (solid Sharpe, consistent)
3. Beta Factor (moderate)
4. Skew Factor (moderate)
5. Kurtosis Factor (?)

## üìã Summary

### The Big Picture

**What We Learned:**

1. **DW Factor Works:** +197% over 4.8 years validates the concept
2. **Contrarian is Right:** Long mean reversion, short momentum
3. **Keep It Simple:** 30d, 7d, equal weight beats complex optimizations
4. **Test Full Cycles:** 2023 alone was misleading (overfitting)
5. **Momentum Fails:** Betting on momentum continuation loses -84%

**What to Do:**

‚úÖ **Deploy:** Contrarian strategy with 30d DW  
‚úÖ **Monitor:** Track performance vs expectations  
‚úÖ **Adapt:** Adjust if market regime changes dramatically  
‚ùå **Avoid:** Risk parity unless in stable low-vol regime  
‚ùå **Never:** Use momentum continuation strategy  

**Expected Results:**

- **Return:** 15-20% annualized
- **Sharpe:** 0.5-0.7
- **Max DD:** 30-40%
- **Consistency:** Positive 4 out of 5 years
