# Merge Conflict Resolution Summary

## Overview
Successfully resolved merge conflicts when merging `main` branch into `cursor/backtest-rebalance-periods-for-beta-14ca`.

## Date
October 29, 2025

## Conflicts Resolved

### 1. `/workspace/execution/all_strategies_config.json`

**Conflict:** Strategy weights and oi_divergence removal

**Resolution:**
- ✅ Removed `oi_divergence` strategy (as done in main branch)
- ✅ Updated weights to match main's redistribution:
  - mean_reversion: 0.6833 (was 0.6371)
  - size: 0.1109 (was 0.1032)
  - carry: 0.0988 (was 0.0920)
  - breakout: 0.0535 (was 0.0500)
  - days_from_high: 0.0535 (was 0.0500)
- ✅ Kept beta strategy with weight 0.0 (available but inactive)
- ✅ Preserved optimal beta parameters:
  - rebalance_days: 5 (optimal based on backtest)
  - beta_window: 90
  - volatility_window: 30
  - long_percentile: 20
  - short_percentile: 80
  - weighting_method: equal_weight
  - long_allocation: 0.5
  - short_allocation: 0.5

### 2. `/workspace/execution/main.py`

**Conflict:** Import statements and strategy registry

**Resolution:**
- ✅ Removed `strategy_oi_divergence` import (commented out)
- ✅ Kept `strategy_beta` import
- ✅ Updated STRATEGY_REGISTRY:
  - Commented out oi_divergence entry
  - Added beta entry
- ✅ Preserved all beta parameter handling in `_build_strategy_params()`

## Final State

### Strategy Weights (Active)
```json
{
  "mean_reversion": 0.6833,
  "size": 0.1109,
  "carry": 0.0988,
  "breakout": 0.0535,
  "days_from_high": 0.0535,
  "beta": 0.0
}
```

### Available Strategies in Registry
1. ✅ days_from_high
2. ✅ breakout
3. ✅ carry
4. ✅ mean_reversion
5. ✅ size
6. ❌ oi_divergence (removed)
7. ✅ **beta** (newly added, inactive)

## Verification

All verifications passed:
- ✅ Beta strategy imports successfully
- ✅ Config JSON is valid
- ✅ OI divergence properly removed
- ✅ Beta parameters preserved with 5-day rebalancing
- ✅ Strategy registry includes 6 active strategies + beta

## Changes from Main Branch

Main branch received these updates between our branch point and now:
1. Volatility factor rebalance period analysis (#227)
2. Size factor rebalance period analysis (#228)
3. Mean reversion rebalance period analysis (#225)
4. OI divergence removal (#234)
5. Trendline breakout signal backtest (#221)

Our additions:
1. Beta factor strategy implementation
2. Beta rebalance period analysis (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 30 days)
3. Beta integration into main.py with optimal 5-day rebalancing

## Commit Details

**Merge Commit:** 229843d
**Message:** 
```
Merge main into beta rebalance branch

- Resolved conflicts in all_strategies_config.json and main.py
- Removed oi_divergence strategy (as per main branch)
- Kept beta strategy integration with 5-day rebalancing
- Updated strategy weights to match main branch distribution
- Beta strategy remains at 0 weight (available but inactive)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Ready to push:** Branch is ahead of origin by 16 commits
2. **Ready to test:** Beta strategy can be enabled by setting weight > 0 in config
3. **Ready to merge:** No conflicts remain, can be merged to main

## Usage

To enable beta strategy:

```json
{
  "strategy_weights": {
    ...
    "beta": 0.15  // Allocate 15% to beta strategy
  }
}
```

To test beta strategy:
```bash
python3 execution/main.py --signals beta --dry-run
```
