## 🎯 First Task (30 Minutes)

1. **Run quick start commands above** (5 min)
2. **Read** `docs/robustness/START_HERE.md` (5 min)
3. **Add validation to one backtest script** (20 min)
   - Open `backtests/scripts/backtest_mean_reversion.py`
   - Copy template from `docs/robustness/QUICK_COMMANDS.md`
   - Test: `python3 backtests/scripts/backtest_mean_reversion.py`
   - Commit: `git commit -am "Add validation to mean_reversion backtest"`

**That's it!** You've made your first improvement. Repeat for other files.

---

## 📅 Week 1 Goals

- ✅ Setup development tools
- ✅ Add validation to 3+ backtest scripts
- ✅ Add validation to 2+ signal scripts
- ✅ Add risk checks to execution
- ✅ Add retry to 2+ API clients

See `docs/robustness/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed daily tasks.

## 💡 Key Benefits

### Immediate (After Week 1)
- ✅ Clear error messages (not cryptic crashes)
- ✅ API calls retry automatically
- ✅ Risk limits prevent catastrophic losses
- ✅ Fail fast with validation

### Short-term (After Month 1)
- ✅ Structured logging everywhere
- ✅ 50%+ test coverage
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline running
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks enforce quality

### Long-term (After Month 2)
- ✅ 80%+ test coverage
- ✅ Self-healing for common issues
- ✅ Comprehensive monitoring
- ✅ System learns from failures
