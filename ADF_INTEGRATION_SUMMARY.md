}
```

## üöÄ How to Activate

To enable the ADF factor in live trading:

### Step 1: Uncomment Code

**In `/workspace/execution/strategies/__init__.py`:**
```python
# Change this:
# from .adf import strategy_adf

# To this:
from .adf import strategy_adf

# And in __all__ list:
# Change:
    # "strategy_adf",  # COMMENTED OUT: Not active yet

# To:
    "strategy_adf",
```

**In `/workspace/execution/main.py`:**
```python
# Line 83: Change this:
    # strategy_adf,  # COMMENTED OUT: Not active yet (integrate but disable)

# To:
    strategy_adf,

# Line 120: Change this:
    # "adf": strategy_adf,  # COMMENTED OUT: Not active yet (integrate but disable)

# To:
    "adf": strategy_adf,

# Lines 286-308: Uncomment the entire elif block for "adf" parameter handling
```

### Step 2: Set Weight in Config

**In `/workspace/execution/all_strategies_config.json`:**

```json
{
  "strategy_weights": {
    "mean_reversion": 0.413702239789196,
    "size": 0.051383399209486,
    "carry": 0.100131752305665,
    "beta": 0.089591567852437,
    "trendline_breakout": 0.047430830039526,
    "volatility": 0.185770750988142,
    "kurtosis": 0.111989459815547,
    "adf": 0.0,  // Start at 0 for testing, then increase
    "breakout": 0.0,
    "days_from_high": 0.0
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Rename Config Key

Change `"_adf_commented_out"` to `"adf"` in the params section.

### Step 4: Test in Dry Run

```bash
cd /workspace/execution
python3 main.py --dry-run
```

Verify ADF strategy appears in output and calculates positions correctly.

### Step 5: Set Allocation Weight

Based on Sharpe ratio of 0.49, suggested weight allocation:

```json
"adf": 0.06  // ~6% allocation (Sharpe 0.49 / Total Sharpe ~8.0)
```

You'll need to rebalance other strategy weights proportionally.

## üìê Strategy Logic

### Trend Following Premium (Recommended)

**Hypothesis:** Trending coins outperform stationary coins in momentum markets.

- **Long:** Coins with high ADF (less negative) = trending/non-stationary
- **Short:** Coins with low ADF (more negative) = stationary/mean-reverting

**Why it works:**
- 2021-2025 was a momentum-driven period
- Trending coins captured large moves
- Stationary coins failed to participate in rallies

### ADF Test Interpretation

```
ADF Statistic:
  -4.0 or lower = Strongly stationary (mean-reverting)
  -3.0 to -2.0  = Moderately stationary
  -2.0 to -1.0  = Weakly stationary
  -1.0 to 0     = Non-stationary (trending)

P-value < 0.05 = Stationary (rejects unit root)
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Dependencies
- **Requires statsmodels:** Already in requirements.txt
- Calculation is computationally intensive (~2-3 mins for 100 coins)

### Risk Considerations
1. **Market Regime Dependent:** Works in momentum markets, may fail in mean-reverting regimes
2. **Concentration Risk:** Strategy typically holds 2-4 positions per side
3. **Rebalancing Costs:** Weekly rebalancing = more transaction costs
4. **Data Requirements:** Needs 60+ days of clean price history

### When to Use
‚úÖ **Use ADF when:**
- Market is in a trending phase
- You have good execution (low slippage)
- Combined with other diversifying factors

‚ùå **Avoid ADF when:**
- Market is range-bound/choppy
- Using as sole strategy (too concentrated)
- High transaction costs

## üìà Performance Context

**Compared to other factors:**

| Factor | Sharpe | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Mean Reversion | 3.14 | Active |
| Volatility | 1.41 | Active |
| Kurtosis | 0.85 | Active |
| Carry | 0.76 | Active |
| Beta | 0.68 | Active |
| **ADF** | **0.49** | **Commented out** |
| Size | 0.39 | Active |
| TLBO | 0.36 | Active |

ADF has moderate Sharpe but good absolute returns. Consider as complementary factor.

## üß™ Testing Checklist

Before going live with ADF:

- [ ] Uncomment all code in 3 files
- [ ] Verify imports work (no errors)
- [ ] Run dry-run test
- [ ] Verify ADF calculations complete
- [ ] Check position sizes are reasonable
- [ ] Start with 0 weight, gradually increase
- [ ] Monitor for 1-2 weeks before full allocation
- [ ] Watch for regime changes (momentum ‚Üí mean reversion)
