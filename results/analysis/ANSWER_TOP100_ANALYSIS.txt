TOP 100 COINS - PRICE DATA COVERAGE ANALYSIS
================================================================================

QUESTION: How is SOL missing from Coinbase spot?

ANSWER: SOL is NOT missing! But there's a bigger problem...

================================================================================
KEY FINDING: DATA HAS MAJOR TEMPORAL GAPS
================================================================================

SOL Example:
  ✅ EXISTS in price dataset
  ❌ Only has data from 2021-06-17 to 2021-10-28 (133 days)
  ❌ Then STOPS - no recent data!

This is true for many major coins:
  - XRP: Only 2020-2021 (stops Jan 2021)
  - DOGE: Only Jun-Oct 2021 (4 months)
  - ADA: Only Mar-Oct 2021 (7 months)
  - BNB: Only 2 days! (Oct 22-24, 2025)
  - USDT: Only May-Oct 2021 (5 months)

================================================================================
TOP 100 COVERAGE SUMMARY
================================================================================

Overall: 63/100 coins exist in dataset (63%)
But:
  - Current data (2025):  33/100 (33%)
  - Old data (pre-2025):  30/100 (30%)  ← THE PROBLEM
  - Missing entirely:     37/100 (37%)

Top 10 Coins:
  ✅ Current: 3/10 (BTC, ETH, LINK)
  ⚠️  Old:    5/10 (XRP, USDT, BNB, SOL, DOGE, ADA)
  ❌ Missing: 2/10 (USDC, TRX)

Only 30% of top 10 coins have usable current data!

================================================================================
WHY THIS HAPPENS
================================================================================

Pattern 1: Data Collection Stopped in October 2021
  Many coins have data that suddenly ends Oct 2021:
    SOL, DOGE, ADA, USDT, DOT, AVAX, SHIB, ICP, etc.
  
  → Likely: Data collection script broke/stopped

Pattern 2: Very Short Periods
  Some coins have only days/weeks of data:
    BNB: 2 days
    HBAR: 15 days
    AVAX: 28 days
    SHIB: 49 days

Pattern 3: Completely Missing (37 coins)
  Including major ones:
    USDC (rank #7, $74B!), TRX (#9, $32B), HYPE (#11, $16B)

================================================================================
IMPACT ON BACKTESTING
================================================================================

Even though 63% exist in dataset, join rate is only 21.8% because:

  1. Temporal mismatch - coin not available at that date
  2. Insufficient history - need 90 days for volatility calc
  3. Data gaps - missing critical periods

Example: October 2025 rebalance
  - Top 150 coins needed
  - 87 exist in dataset overall (58%)
  - Only 42 available at that date (28%)  ← Why join rate is low

================================================================================
COVERAGE BY TIER
================================================================================

Market Cap Tier    Current   Old Data   Missing   Total
----------------------------------------------------------
Top 10             3 (30%)   5 (50%)    2 (20%)   8/10
11-20              4 (40%)   3 (30%)    3 (30%)   7/10
21-30              2 (20%)   4 (40%)    4 (40%)   6/10
31-50              5 (25%)   6 (30%)    9 (45%)   11/20
51-100            19 (38%)  12 (24%)   19 (38%)   31/50

The larger the coin, the MORE LIKELY it has data issues!

================================================================================
WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN
================================================================================

Immediate:
  1. Resume data collection for stopped coins (Oct 2021 batch)
  2. Backfill gaps from 2021-2025
  3. Add missing top coins (USDC, TRX, HYPE, TON, etc.)

Long-term:
  1. Expand data sources:
     - Binance (for BNB, many altcoins)
     - Kraken (for XRP continuous coverage)
     - Hyperliquid (already trading there)
     - CoinGecko (comprehensive backup)
  
  2. Automated daily collection with monitoring
  3. Target: 90%+ coverage of top 100 (currently 33%)

CONCLUSION
================================================================================

"SOL is missing" → FALSE
  SOL exists but has incomplete temporal coverage (4 months only)

Real problem:
  • 63% of top 100 coins exist in dataset (good!)
  • But only 33% have current usable data (bad!)
  • Data collection stopped for major coins in Oct 2021
  • Creates low backtest join rate (21.8%)

Fix priority:
  1. Resume stopped coins (highest priority!)
  2. Backfill 2021-2025 gaps
  3. Expand data sources
  4. Maintain pipeline

Current state: Can only backtest with ~33 continuously available coins
Target state: Should be able to use 90+ coins from top 100
