# Python Execution Rules

## Dependency Management
- Always run `pip install -r requirements.txt` first before executing any Python scripts
- Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the application

## Python Version
- Always use `python3` command instead of `python`
- Explicitly use Python 3 for all script executions

## Backtesting Best Practices
- When generating backtest, make sure to use next-day returns (`.shift(-1)`) to avoid lookahead bias
- Signals generated on day T should be executed using returns from day T+1

# API Usage Rules

## CCXT/Hyperliquid API Rate Limits
- **NEVER** run scripts that hit the ccxt/Hyperliquid API (e.g., `ccxt_get_positions.py`, `ccxt_get_balance.py`, `ccxt_make_order.py`) for random testing or verification purposes
- Only execute API calls when:
  - Explicitly requested by the user (e.g., "check my positions", "get my balance")
  - Part of the actual script the user requested to run (e.g., running `main.py` which legitimately needs position data)
- Do NOT call these scripts to "verify" code changes or "test" implementations
- Hyperliquid has strict rate limits: 1200 requests/minute, 20 requests/second
- Unnecessary API calls can cause rate limiting issues and interfere with live trading operations

# Documentation Organization

## Documentation Structure
- All documentation files (*.md) must be placed in the `/workspace/docs/` directory
- Do NOT create markdown files in the project root directory
- Use the existing docs structure and subdirectories (e.g., `docs/robustness/`) for organization
- When creating new documentation, check the docs/ directory first to understand the existing organization
- Factor specifications should be named `*_FACTOR_SPEC.md`
- Backtest results should be named `*_BACKTEST_RESULTS.md`
- Implementation guides should use `*_IMPLEMENTATION_*.md` or `*_README.md` patterns
