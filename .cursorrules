# Python Execution Rules

## Dependency Management
- Always run `pip install -r requirements.txt` first before executing any Python scripts
- Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the application

## Python Version
- Always use `python3` command instead of `python`
- Explicitly use Python 3 for all script executions

## Backtesting Best Practices
- When generating backtest, make sure to use next-day returns (`.shift(-1)`) to avoid lookahead bias
- Signals generated on day T should be executed using returns from day T+1
